<h2 class="bold"><a id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>In 1909 there appeared in the Russian military
journal, “Voenny Sbornik,” twelve articles from the
pen of a distinguished Russian officer.</p>

<p>The writer—Lieutenant-General (then Colonel)
Tretyakov—as commander of the Western Section of
the Defences had taken a prominent and gallant
part in the historic struggle for the possession of
Port Arthur.</p>

<p>His narrative—of which this work is a translation—placed
before his countrymen, in simple and intimate
language, his experiences at Nan Shan and
within the beleaguered fortress. The impression
created throughout Russia was deep and immediate.</p>

<p>No more touching and direct appeal to judge its
beaten heroes sympathetically and fairly has ever
been made to a nation. Six thousand miles from
the Fatherland the author’s regiment, the 5th
Siberian Rifles—and many another—fought to the
death for God and the Czar. This plain tale is a
fitting record of their soldierly devotion. As such we
offer it to English readers, assured that every page
must bring home the conviction that here we have
the actual history of the fighting line—as perhaps
nothing else in our language gives it.</p>

<p>We follow the fortunes of the General’s own unit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
we live with his men amidst the bloodstained wreck
of their trenches on 203 Metre Hill, losing all thought
of the general conduct of the attack and defence of
the fortress—in a word, we are transported from the
dry bones of military history to the living realities
of the battlefield.</p>

<p>To the soldier these annals afford example after
example, deeply interesting and instructive, of
military cause and effect. In theory a specialist’s
business, here we see laid bare the foundation on
which stands scientific siege warfare. The infantry
soldier’s readiness to die makes possible the rôle of
the gunner and the sapper—his blood cements their
work.</p>

<p>From the historical point of view these pages
exemplify the rare incident of a writer of the beaten
side giving to the world an opportunity of comparing
his account with that of the victor—not years after
the strife, but while the sword is yet barely sheathed.
The student of war will doubtless fully appreciate
the value of such contemporary history.</p>

<p>In Semenov’s “Rasplata” we have a bitter lament
for “what might have been.” The psychological
contrast is now before us—a commander who rarely
criticizes, but, instead, shows us every one cheerfully
doing his best to make bricks without straw.</p>

<p>In him the British soldier will recognize a brother-in-arms,
whose unassuming character and cheerful
self-restraint in the midst of adversity must appeal to
his national instincts.</p>

<p>This is perhaps hardly the place to enter upon a
critical discussion of the strategy and tactics of the
conflict, but we cannot refrain from reminding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
reader that in this great siege we beheld the remarkable
spectacle of an army sacrificing itself to secure
for its fleet the command of the sea. No more
eloquent testimony to the value to an island power
of that command has ever been presented.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we add a short biographical sketch
of the author, and we take this opportunity to
acknowledge with gratitude his most kind and invaluable
assistance in the translation and illustration
of the work.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Nikolai Alexandrovitch Tretyakov
was born in the Simbirsky Government in 1856.
Educated in Moscow, he passed through the Constantine
Military School and the Engineer Academy
before being gazetted in 1875 to the 6th Sapper Battalion
as Second-Lieutenant.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War he
accompanied this battalion to the front, and, volunteering
to serve in the 4th Battalion before Plevna,
took part in that famous siege, and was the first to
enter the Turkish stronghold by the Grivitsa road,
which he did at the head of a company of sappers.
He was rewarded for his services with the 3rd Class of
the Order of Stanislav and the 3rd Class of the Order
of Anne, together with the rank of Staff-Captain.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the war Staff-Captain Tretyakov
passed through the Nicholas Engineer Academy,
and was then appointed to the command of a company
in a sapper battalion stationed at Kiev. Retaining
this post for eight years, he attained the rank
of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1893, and in the same year
was sent to the Far East at the head of an East<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Siberian Engineer battalion. During the Boxer
Rising he helped to fortify the Nan Shan position,
and was present at the capture of the Ta-ku Forts,
afterwards joining in the advance on Pekin. General
Lineivitch marked his appreciation of the good work
done in this campaign by Lieutenant-Colonel Tretyakov
by recommending him for “the gold sword.”
This honour was followed by appointment to the
command of the 5th East Siberian Rifle Regiment,
and for the next two years he was engaged in protecting
the railway from Pekin against the attacks of
the Hunhutzes, and was again decorated, this time
with the 3rd Class of the Order of Vladimir.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War the
Czar conferred upon him the much-coveted “George
Cross,” the 1st Class of the Order of Stanislav, the
1st Class of the Order of Anne, and the rank of Major-General.
On his return to Russia he commanded
the 3rd Sapper Brigade at Kiev until, on promotion
to the rank of Lieutenant-General, he became
Inspector-General of Engineers in the Kiev District.</p>

<p class="hang small">Arrival of the 5th Regiment at Chin-chou—Rumours of war—Declaration
of war—Restoring the fortifications on the Nan Shan position—Watching
for the Japanese—First signs of the enemy—A
reconnaissance in force—Fighting to the north of Chin-chou,
May 16.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Staff of the 5th East Siberian Rifles, with the
2nd, 3rd, and 4th Companies, arrived at Chin-chou
on April 1, 1903. The regiment, for the past three
years, had been stationed at various points on the
Yellow Sea, engaged in guarding from the attacks
of the Hunhutzes the railways rebuilt by our railway
battalion in conjunction with the 1st East Siberian
Sappers, the unit which I commanded during the
Boxer campaign.</p>

<p>The regiment began to settle down at Chin-chou
and to transfer its baggage there from Novokievsk,
after which, the men having first been housed, some
large buildings were run up for the accommodation
of the horses and transport vehicles, both of which
were in a splendid condition, notwithstanding the
wear and tear of the campaign just gone through.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Our two-wheeled carts were all in good repair;
the horses I had bought from the Germans at
Tientsin, when they offered for sale a magnificent
lot of animals, brought at enormous cost from
Austria and America, and, though costing us only
about 80 roubles<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> per head, one could not speak
too highly of them. I handed over our former
small horses to our mounted scout detachment,<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
which, owing to some misunderstanding, was without
any. Thus, the best-equipped unit of all our forces
in China, we spent the whole of the summer of 1903
at Chin-chou.</p>

<p>Throughout that summer we were worried by the
Hunhutzes, and not only were the scouts constantly
engaged in encounters with these brigands,
but we were also obliged to send out strong detachments,
as the police and scouts combined proved
insufficient to deal with them. The authorities at
home knew very little about all this, since the local
commanders refrained from sending in reports about
the Hunhutze bands. Seeing that the police could
not cope with them, I personally took all measures
in my power against them; but when I spoke to the
commandant about taking further steps, saying
that I could not understand why he did not call in
the help of the regular troops, the answer was always
the same: “My dear Colonel, the authorities think
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>that we do nothing at all, or else suspect us of pusillanimity;
there has already been some unpleasantness
about it, and the civil governor has flatly
refused to make any report to the Viceroy.” So the
people had to pay more and more tribute per head,
and the Hunhutzes threatened our military posts
as well as those of the Chinese police. In the end
we had regular pitched battles with them, and the
scouts and various regiments in the Kuan-tung
Peninsula, as well as the 5th Regiment, lost a considerable
number in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>“What’s their little game?” we asked.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said some; “the Chinese say that there
are Japanese among them.”</p>

<p>“But what are the Japanese after?”</p>

<p>“They say they are going to fight <i>us</i>. Our people
from Shanghai tell us that the Japanese officers
speak to ours about nothing but politics: ‘You,’
they say, ‘must take Persia under your protection;
but we will have Korea, which we have tried to obtain
for centuries.’”</p>

<p>At the end of the summer we received orders to
prepare quarters for all the companies of our regiment
(except the 6th, which was at Pi-tzu-wo),
and in August they all arrived. From the first
moment of the concentration of the regiment it
became clear to us that relations with Japan had
become strained, and that a rupture might be expected.
Soon after we heard it rumoured that the
3rd Battalion was going to join us, and then we
heard that they were forming a 7th Rifle Division
in Port Arthur. The officers spoke of war, but as,
according to those who ought to know, the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
could only put 300,000 men into the field, we all
felt quite confident. However, when it became known
that General Kashtalinski’s division was going to
the Yalu, we did not feel quite the same assurance,
since it would be very difficult to defend Port
Arthur with only two divisions. French officers, we
heard, were greatly surprised that we did not think
seriously of war when we really were on the very
eve of it. It must be admitted that, while contemplating
the peaceful aspect of Port Arthur, we did
indeed forget that we were living on the edge of a
volcano.</p>

<p>The awakening came on the night of February 8–9,
when I was roused up and given a telegram from
General Glinski, on opening which I rubbed my eyes
as I read:</p>

<p>“The Japanese fleet is fifty miles from the coast
and making for Port Arthur. Be on the alert.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I thought to myself, “there is nothing to
fear; our fleet will soon make an end of theirs.”</p>

<p>I do not know why, but we always believed in
the invulnerability of our fleet, more especially
since we heard that the Admiralty had refused to
buy from Argentina the two splendid armoured
cruisers <i>Nisshin</i> and <i>Kasuga</i>, saying that we were
strong enough without them. (This may be a
misconception, but I am speaking of what we heard
at the time.)</p>

<p>Having sent for the commander of the 1st Scout
Detachment, I told him to proceed to Kerr Bay
and the Ta-ku Shan Peninsula, to keep a look-out
on the shore. I then lay down, and was just dozing
of! when they called me again. Another telegram<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
from General Glinski; it only contained three words:
“War declared. Glinski.” This did not worry me
very much. “Let them come first and destroy
our fleet, and then they can land in Southern Korea,”
I thought to myself.</p>

<p>However, I sent the detachment, and with it
ten mounted scouts to act as orderlies. Early in
the morning I went out on to the Nan Shan position,
where, as I had expected, all the trenches and batteries
were in a ruined condition, and in the winter,
when the ground was as hard as rock, it would be extremely
difficult to restore the fortifications. Returning
from the position, I met an officer coming out of
Port Arthur, who told me that three of our battleships
had been blown up suddenly by Japanese destroyers.<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This news was a great shock to me. A landing
was now possible, not only in Southern Korea, but
even in our rear, and it was absolutely essential to
hurry on with the strengthening of the position.
But now we had nothing whatever to work with,
and so I had to collect all the tools available in the
town, which, thanks to the help of Captain Preegorovski,
a very smart and energetic officer, was done
remarkably quickly. I told off working parties,
who set to work to restore the advanced trenches,
but the frozen earth would not yield, and the shovels
only served for throwing up the lumps of soil loosened
by the picks.</p>

<p>Our first recruits and reservists arrived on February 16,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>and had all to be thoroughly drilled. According
to our mobilization plans all the companies
of the regiment, except the 1st,<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> should be at the disposal
of the officer commanding, and orders were
given accordingly, and the 5th and 6th Companies
immediately called in, the latter having all this time
been engaged with the Hunhutzes. The town of
Chin-chou became so crowded that I quartered
about half the companies in barracks behind the
Nan Shan position, and had the regimental baggage
transferred to Port Arthur, where I had hired a
private house for its storage, the authorities having
refused to give us Government buildings.</p>

<p>Some mounted scouts were sent out to watch the
shore under the command of Major Pavlovski, commandant
of the Gandzalinski district, and a section
of rifles was also allotted to him under Acting
Ensign<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Shiskin of the reserve, as he had complained
that the Hunhutzes had become so daring as to be
threatening his quarters. We ourselves watched
Kerr Bay and the bays adjoining by establishing
posts and a chain of mounted scouts, the practice
of hunting up the Hunhutzes being abandoned.</p>

<p>Now began a period of activity such as I had never
before experienced in the whole of my service. We
fortified the positions, brought up stores, instructed
the recruits and reservists, of whom more than half
the regiment was now composed, and, lastly, kept
a look-out for the enemy, for which latter duty
two hundred men were required daily. All this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>made the situation of the regiment a very difficult
one, the more so, as the enemy was free to effect a
landing between Chin-chou and Port Arthur, and
cut us off from the fortress. For these reasons I considered
our situation not only difficult, but dangerous.</p>

<p>The 3rd Battalion arrived on April 2. They were
a fine lot of men. I quartered them in the town,
and disposed the old companies in the villages situated
in front of the position.</p>

<p>Major<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Schwartz, an engineer officer, was attached
to us to help us with the fortifications, and had
brought money with him for the hire of workmen.
From this time, too, we began practising manœuvring
on the position while yet the enemy gave us a short
respite, which we endeavoured to make the most of.</p>

<p>Sixty versts<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> from Port Arthur, on the isthmus
joining the southern part of Kuan-tung to the
mainland beyond, and occupying half the breadth
of the isthmus, is some high ground cut up lengthwise
and crossways by a number of deep ravines,
which mark the well-known Nan Shan position.</p>

<p>In the last China campaign,<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> there being a danger
of Chinese troops moving on Port Arthur from the
north, this position was turned into a vast series of
fortified batteries by Colonel—now General—Kholodovski,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>and when the sapper battalion, of which
I was in command at that time, came up to the position
to complete its fortification, all the commanding
points were found to be crowned by batteries, armed
with heavy guns. We set to work at the time to
build trenches for the infantry, a work already
partially done on the right flank, whereupon we built
two redoubts in front of the batteries in advanced
positions, and one central one near Battery No. 13.</p>

<p>All these fortifications, now almost completely
in ruins, had to form part of our present line of
defence. I was put in command, and Schwartz and
myself set to work to restore the forts. I was told
that the 5th Regiment would have to defend the
position against the Japanese, and I recognized at
once that we had not sufficient men. Having carefully
calculated the minimum numbers required to
hold these works, I arrived at the conclusion that
for a more or less successful defence it was necessary
to have at least three regiments. (The peninsula
was 3 versts across,<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> with 2 versts of shallow water
on either flank, increasing to 8 versts at low tide.)</p>

<div class="center-img-landscape" id="image_Page_8">
  <img src="images/i_b_008fp_600x380.jpg" width="600" height="380" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="x-small">GUN-PITS.</p>
    <p class="x-small left">p. 8]</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In front of the position, and 2 versts from it,
stood Chin-chou, a town surrounded by an old Chinese
wall, 3½ versts in length, and proof against field-artillery
fire. It would be extremely difficult to
storm the wall in face of artillery fire from the main
position, and as also it gave good cover from the
enemy’s rifle and gun fire, it was decided to occupy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the town as an advanced post. It did, in fact, cover
the front of the position, and it would be a difficult
matter to attack the heights beyond without having
first taken it. The state of affairs became, however,
more complicated, as at least two companies were
necessary for the defence of the town, thus leaving
us only nine companies for the main position.</p>

<p>We were ordered to defend ourselves to the last
drop of blood. When I told General Fock of the
difficulty of defending the position with one regiment,
which was not even up to full strength, he replied:
“Do you know, if I were in your place, I should say
to my commanding officer: ‘Leave me only two
companies, and I shall know better how to die with
<i>them</i>, than with a whole regiment.’” From this I
concluded that, instead of a successful defence, he
had some other object in view, the nature of which
I could not then fathom.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, impossible to defend this position
successfully. The enemy’s fleet could make an
appearance on both flanks and at the rear. Our
opponent, moreover, had vastly superior numbers,
and his batteries eventually spread out in a circle
which commanded the crowded mass of our guns on
the Nan Shan heights, while the absence of a sufficient
number of bomb-proofs and cover for reserves completed
the difficulties of the position of the defenders.
We built field bakeries, and dug wells on the position,
and, as the possibility of a landing in our rear was
realized, we were ordered to fortify the rear as well
as the front, which is really saying that the position
assumed the nature of a fortress.</p>

<p>I had indicated the position lying immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to the south of the Nan Shan position as being an
incomparably better one. On it we could have met
the enemy, while he was in the act of filing across
the isthmus, on a broad front and with a numerous
and well-placed artillery, our flanks on this
position being protected from any action on the part
of the enemy’s fleet. General Kholodovski’s idea,
however, prevailed, perhaps because the work needed
to carry it out was almost completed (they did not
realize that to restore the fortifications and to build
new ones was practically one and the same thing).
Be this as it may, the constant talk about the Nan
Shan position had made it so popular, that for many
its very name became a “mascot.” The view and field
of fire from it were certainly splendid, and I took
good care to see that the defenders should feel that
the position could be successfully held, and satisfied
myself that they felt confident of their capability
to do so.</p>

<p>Continuing incessantly to fortify the position,
the 5th Regiment watched the shore 30 versts to
the north by mounted and infantry Scout detachments,
sometimes employing the regular companies
on this service. We received orders every day by
wire to be on the alert and to watch for a landing,
and I did everything possible to prevent being taken
by surprise. Half of the mounted detachment I
sent to Pi-tzu-wo, the most likely point for a landing,
and all the mounted scouts of the 14th Regiment
were sent to the same locality to watch the coast.
A section of a company, under an officer, and ten
mounted scouts were sent to Godzarlin<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> to watch
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Terminal Point. In Kerr Bay and Deep Bay was
Lieutenant Vaseeliev with the 1st Infantry Scout
Detachment, and ten mounted scouts, and on a
headland in Sulivan Bay a post of twenty-five sharp-shooters
and six mounted scouts, while the shores
of Chin-chou Bay were guarded by the men occupying
the town. From Godzarlin up to the position I
had distributed a flying post of the 2nd half of the
Mounted Scouts, ten of whom I kept with me for
orderly duties.</p>

<p>At this time the regiment was disposed as follows:
in the town of Chin-chou, the 10th Company under
Major Goosov, the 3rd Scout Detachment under
Captain Koudriavtsev, and a mixed force of sixty
men under Lieutenant Golenko, an officer who had
distinguished himself against the Hunhutzes. The
3rd Company occupied the village of Lu-chia-tun,
in front of the centre of the position, while the 2nd
Company was in the village of Ma-chia-tun, in front
of the right flank, and the 6th Company in the village
of Ssu-chia-tun, behind the left flank, the remainder
being quartered behind the centre of the position.
Major Schwartz, with about a dozen men, was quartered
in some shelters in the centre of the position.
All the regimental and officers’ baggage was stored
near the position and in Port Arthur. Lieutenant-Colonel
Eremeiev, who had voluntarily joined the
regiment from the reserve, and whom I had personally
known at the Academy and the Engineer College, I
appointed commandant of the town.</p>

<p>As soon as the men of the regiment had settled
down in their various quarters, work on the position
was pushed forward with feverish haste. Every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
day thousands of Chinese<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and soldiers worked at
it; they brought up building material, constructed
obstacles, dug wells, and the soldiers concurrently
underwent musketry and field training; and all
this at a time when we expected a landing every
moment either in front or in rear. As the regiment
might have to withstand a regular siege, we set to
work to make splinter-proofs for storing food, supplies,
and small-arm ammunition, though the means at
our disposal were very limited. We had in hand
no more than 60,000 roubles, and so we only made
two splinter-proofs, neither of them remarkably
long or broad, and began the construction of four
wells without, however, much hope of finding water.
The cold weather hampered us sadly. The soil was
frozen hard, and our shovels and picks, of which
we only had a limited supply, kept on breaking.
The companies occupying the town, too, worked hard
at putting it also into a state of defence. It was
proposed to strengthen the existing caponiers and
the corners of the town wall, and to build bomb-proofs
for the protection of the reserves against
splinters.</p>

<p>The enemy was evidently waiting for something,
and we felt more secure every day. We improvised
an entertainment hall from one of the barrack rooms,
decorated it as well as we could, and put a gramophone
in it; hence our dinners and suppers went
off in right merry style. We used to get a lot of
people coming out to see the position, and gladly
received them, as we got news from them of what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>was going on in the outside world. Of course, one
could not be sure that the information was exactly
correct, but, such as it was, it generally emanated
from the staff. The majority of our informants
held the opinion that we should never see a shot
fired, and that the whole action of the war would
be limited to sea fighting and the occupation of the
southern part of Korea by the Japanese, as the
latter could never raise more than 300,000 men,
and, when our battleships had been repaired, we
should smash up their fleet and they would have to
make terms. No one doubted that our fleet <i>would</i>
destroy the Japanese navy, because our naval commanders
were more active than the Japanese, our
sailors infinitely better at gunnery, and, finally,
our ships’ armour was very much stronger, as it
was “annealed.”<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Our naval experts told us all
this. No attention whatever was paid to the fact
that the Japanese had five first-class battleships
while we had only two,<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and that torpedo craft,
of which the Japanese possessed a hundred, had not
yet proved their full power of independent action.
Our informants did not say how they had come by
their knowledge, but they always laid particular
stress on the bravery of our sailors.</p>

<p>“Never mind if you do see drunken sailors on
shore, nor how rudely officers may answer to any
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
remark addressed to them—on shore; on their ships
they cultivate an iron discipline.”</p>

<p>If any one stated that the Japanese fleet was
considerably stronger than ours, our tellers of fairy
tales would contemptuously answer, especially if
the individual was a naval man: “A lot you know!
Why do you think the Government refused to buy
the <i>Nisshin</i> and <i>Kasuga</i> from Argentina? Because
we are strong enough without them; otherwise they
would not have refused such a purchase.” And we
listeners, satisfied with such arguments, were quickly
laughing and joking and telling stories. I always
sat at the head of the table, and it was a pleasure
to me to listen to the stories and watch the happy
faces of those round me, many of whom felt no forebodings
then of the destiny awaiting them.</p>

<p>While fortifying the position we made some
experiments on the effect of rifle fire directed against
targets sheltered by loopholed parapets, as compared
with that against targets in the open. It always
happened that at a range of 200 yards the effect was
considerably greater against loopholed targets, while
at longer ranges the latter suffered most. Since, in
addition, we ran the risk of hostile shrapnel, we also
experimented with this type of fire, and found that
20 rounds at a range of 1 verst put out of action
half the defenders of the earth-work, when they stood
in the open on the glacis. It was therefore decided
to make loopholes everywhere and to provide the
detachments with plank overhead cover, which,
with General Fock’s approval, was carried out on the
succeeding days.</p>

<p>Senior officers frequently visited the position.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
General Kondratenko came out before we started
working, and said that we must occupy the town as
strongly as possible. Generals Fock and Nadyein
were frequently with us, sometimes staying two or
three days. General Fock talked a great deal with
the officers, giving his opinion on the way of defending
the position and ground in front of it. He
thought of meeting the enemy in front of the position,
near the villages lying to the north of Mount Sampson,
and we often went out reconnoitring with him, and
thoroughly studied the ground, but though he insisted
on the necessity of fortifying it, we had no means
of doing so. The general, it seems, had not told
off the regiments of his own division to any work.
Only the 5th Regiment continued working, and the
nearer the time of our meeting with the enemy approached,
the further advanced and stronger became
our field works. Judging from what I heard from
superior officers, it was <i>not</i> intended to defend the
Nan Shan position stubbornly; hence they would
not let us have enough money for its fortification, and
they sent up no artillery. But the closer our meeting
with the enemy impended, the more I became convinced
that the position <i>would</i> be stubbornly defended.</p>

<p>From certain remarks of General Fock it seemed
as if it was not necessary to make a stubborn defence.
The general, for instance, once said to me: “You
know that less heroism is required to defend this
position than to retreat from it. Those who do not
understand the true position of affairs are beginning
to call General Fock a traitor!”</p>

<p>Indeed, it was impossible not to fear a landing of
the Japanese in rear of the position simultaneously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
with a landing at Pi-tzu-wo, and this was so obvious
that the position was ordered to be fortified in rear.
The regiment was in a bad way, and I felt downhearted
at not being able to carry out many of General
Fock’s suggestions as to the fortification of the position
and the means of defending it.</p>

<p>Attaching great importance to the grazing effect
of shell, General Fock insisted that the defensive
line should be continued right down to the foot of
the Nan Shan Hills. Without making a single exception,
without taking into consideration that the
slopes of the hills were long and gentle, and served
as a most difficult obstacle to an attacker, and also
completely losing sight of the fact that by carrying
our trenches down to the foot of the hills we exposed
our companies to fire from the opposite hills, and
thus assisted the attackers, he stuck to his point
and insisted on our extending our line to a total
frontage of 8 versts. In speaking of them, he called
our top tier of trenches “swallows’ nests,” and always
added: “You, of course, are glad to put your regiment
right up under the sky!” I at once pointed
out to the general that he had completely ignored
the fact that the heights formed a natural and difficult
obstacle to pass, that every inequality in the
ground below (of which there were many) gave the
enemy cover from our fire, and that shot bursting
on graze would not have any effect; that we had
only one regiment with which to defend the position,
and that we ought to make our dispositions with
due regard to this unpleasant circumstance. Upon
this, General Fock lost his temper, exclaiming that
only traitors placed their men under the artillery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
fire of the enemy, and that the intervals between
men in trenches should be 20 paces, or certainly
not less than 10 paces, and then there would be no
swallows’ nests for them to occupy. I answered that
if we should place our unseasoned troops, the majority
of whom were recruits and reservists, at 20-paces
interval, each one would feel himself isolated and
thrown out before an advancing foe without any
support, and it might prove that in the moment of
need he would be without the moral support of his
commander. At the same time I did not lose the
opportunity of saying that we had but eleven companies
in the regiment, and that if they were spread
out over a frontage of 8 versts I should have a very
weak line of defence, liable to be broken through at
the slightest pressure, and if I were to keep only one
company in reserve, which was absolutely indispensable,
I should then have a large gap in the line absolutely
unoccupied; was a stubborn defence possible under
these circumstances? Of course, I understood that
General Fock, by throwing his firing line well forward,
wished to lessen their losses from the enemy’s rifle
and shrapnel fire. Granted, this was important,
and was quite feasible at the beginning of the battle.
If I had had only a few reserves with which to
strengthen threatened points, I should have had
nothing to urge against the 20-paces interval
even. But there were no reserves told off for the
5th Regiment, although General Nadyein told me
that I should be supported, and that the 15th Regiment
would be posted near Ta-fang-shen<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; but when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>I asked him, “Then, when they are needed, I
can use them?” he said: “You want to command
a whole division then, do you?” On the whole,
therefore, the plan of action at Nan Shan was not
very plain to me. One thing was at length clear—I
had it from General Kondratenko—that we must
defend the position to our last drop of blood, and to
this end I prepared both officers and men. We
began to make field kitchens in the trenches; we
brought up provisions to the position and put them
in bomb-proofs, cleared the ground for bivouacking
in places covered from the enemy’s fire, and built
shelters for the men in the trenches themselves and
in the fortifications.</p>

<p>The enemy made no sign, the weather was splendid,
and we peacefully continued our work of constructing
cover from shrapnel fire and of preparing obstacles.</p>

<p>From the end of February the enemy’s ships constantly
appeared in Deep and Kerr Bays; luckily
we had already set up a telephone there and connected
it with the Naval Observing Station, of which the
gallant and enterprising Naval Lieutenant Ditchmann
held charge. There was a certain amount of
firing from the Japanese ships and an attempt to
land from one of their gunboats, but our men drove
them off. In view of this, the scouts under Lieutenant
Kragelski were reinforced by the addition
of some mounted scouts under Lieutenant Sietchko,
and on March 7 Major Stempnevski (jun.), with
the 7th Company, was sent to Kerr Bay. Two
mountain guns, under Lieutenant Naoomov, were sent
with the 7th Company. This detachment was formed
from the 5th Regiment; the horses were taken from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the transport, the guns we had brought with us from
China, and the drivers were our own men, but the
officers and gun detachments were sent out from Port
Arthur.</p>

<p>General Nadyein wished to acquaint himself personally
with the position of affairs in the two bays,
and on March 23 I accompanied him to Kerr Bay.
While still some way off, we saw three large Japanese
ships and five destroyers. On arriving we found
the 7th Company and our two guns on the position.
They were so disposed as to be able to sweep the
entrance to Kerr Bay and to oppose the enemy’s
advance if he effected a landing on the end of the
Ta-ku Shan Peninsula, where we had two weak
advanced posts. The Japanese shells pitched as
far up as the ravine behind which the company had
taken cover, and the Japanese gunners fired even
on single individuals if they exposed themselves for
a moment.</p>

<p>We were told that our artillery (two small 32-mm.
guns forming the section under the command of
Naoomov) had done some excellent practice on the
enemy’s destroyers, which had consequently retreated
from the bay. General Nadyein came to the conclusion
that the enemy intended to land in the
bay, and gave me some orders in case this should
prove to be the case. It was 12 versts from the
bay to the position, and 24 to the end of the
Ta-ku Shan Peninsula. In the event of a landing,
I was to support the 7th Company and the scout
detachments with a battalion. If, however, they
had wished to force a landing in considerable strength,
the whole of the 5th Regiment would not have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
able to prevent it. To oppose a landing is a very
difficult business, and here the rugged coast added
considerably to the difficulties of the defender. The
bays cut right into the coast-line, and the hills made
intercommunication exceedingly difficult. Having
enticed the defenders to some point off the shore
by a small feint landing, or by threatening a landing
in force, the attacker could, in a quarter of an hour,
make a sudden rush from another point, where he
could then land without any opposition on the part
of the regiment defending the shore. For this reason
we did not hope to prevent a landing, but thought
that the defence of the position would considerably
delay the enemy’s advance on Port Arthur.</p>

<p>More than all I feared a landing in Dalny Bay,
which was eminently suited for such an enterprise.
Such a landing would divide the strength of the
garrison, and would free the enemy from the necessity
of an attack on the Nan Shan position. Under
cover of the great guns of the fleet a landing was
possible at all places where the depth of water was
sufficient for the large ships to come in close enough
for effective gun fire.</p>

<p>Having inspected the bay and the detachment,
we, accompanied by shots from large naval guns,
returned to the position untouched. On the following
day the 7th Company and scout detachments
beat back a small attempt at a landing, for which
the officers were recommended for high orders, which,
however, they never received. Lieutenant Ditchmann
sank one of the enemy’s ships; I myself went to
Kerr Bay and saw two masts projecting from the
sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>About this time, <i>i.e.</i> March 24, the Nan Shan
position was armed with artillery, and we awaited
the enemy with light hearts, thinking that our artillery,
consisting of 56-mm. and 6-in. short guns,
were superior to the enemy’s field pieces. When, however,
we continued to complain that one regiment
was insufficient for defending the whole position, our
commanders reassured us by saying that the enemy
would not attack the position from all sides at once,
but would choose one special point for the assault.
I did not ask for explanations, as this view appeared
to be sound enough. About April 2 General Smirnov
came out, and, in a fearful rain-storm, inspected
the whole position; he seemed surprised that the
position was fortified to the south as well. I explained
to him that we anticipated an attack from
the rear, as the enemy could land behind Dalny.
Having told me that I must construct a large redoubt
behind the position, in order to cover a retreat, the
general went to Dalny.</p>

<p>On the night of May 4 one of our scouts came up
with a report from Major Pavlovski that a Japanese
squadron had appeared north of Terminal Point,<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and was landing an army. On the morning of the
5th, it was reported that a Japanese fleet of thirty-nine
transports,<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> covered by three large warships,
one of which flew the Admiral’s flag, was landing
troops near the mouth of the Ta-scha River, and in
a bay to the north; about a battalion was said to
have already landed. We immediately reported
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>this to higher authority, whereupon the regiment
occupied its positions and did not leave them day
or night.</p>

<p>Captain Andreievski was ordered to watch the
movements of the enemy closely, and from this time
forth to the end of the siege our mounted corps were
in touch with the Japanese. A large force, with
cavalry and guns, had been disembarked, and soon
after we received a telegram to the effect that a
landing had also taken place near Pi-tzu-wo.</p>

<p>On the night of May 5 three wounded men of the
Mounted Scout Detachment, two of the 14th Regiment,
and one of ours, were brought in. The enemy
had sent out his magnificently mounted cavalry
from the eastern to the western shore towards
the railway. It was said that a battalion, to which
had been added a mounted scout detachment, with
which we never obtained touch, had detrained at
Shih-san-li-tai station, having come from General
Kuropatkin’s army.</p>

<p>General Fock decided to make a reconnaissance
in force, as nobody knew the exact strength of the
troops which had landed. The enemy’s cavalry, in
very considerable numbers, strengthened by infantry
and Hunhutzes,<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> completely screened from us the
landing points and the early movements of the
Japanese. It was reported that they were moving
towards Shih-san-li-tai, and that their landing place
had been strongly fortified.</p>

<p>Towards evening on May 8 all the regiments
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>of the division, except the 15th which was with
Stessel in Port Arthur, and I with my two battalions,
moved out along the road leading towards
the place of the landing, and all had to pass the
night in positions detailed to them along that
road. Having reached their allotted destinations,
the regiments received further orders to continue
their night march, the object of which was, apparently,
to sweep the stretch of country to the south-east
of Shih-san-li-tai station (this operation was
termed “Manœuvre” in the order). The enemy,
in unknown strength, was somewhere between Chang-chia-tun
and Shih-san-li-tai. Up to the time our
regiments had occupied their positions, our scouts
had reported nothing trustworthy about the enemy,
and I expected to meet them every minute. The
5th Regiment, like all the others probably, was
ordered: “At 1 a.m. to move from its bivouacs
and be at dawn at height No. so-and-so.” I did
not know what to do; all our maps had the names
of the villages defaced, the contours were scarcely
marked, none of the heights of the various hills
were given, and how to find, at night, a certain unknown
height No. so-and-so, which might be a good
10 versts from where we were, was too much for
me. I must add, too, that we had no guides with
us; no amount of money could buy them. So I
repaired to General Fock with my doubts. The staff
had already settled down to sleep, and fatigue and
the certainty of the forthcoming battle had made
them all very irritable. Be it said, however, to the
honour of the staff, they realized fully the difficulties
of the night march, and an order was sent out immediately,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
postponing the time of the advance until
3 a.m., when they knew that the dawn would just
begin to break, forgetting, however, that the dawn
comes very quickly, and that it is quite dark till
just before the sun actually rises. It was decided
that the chief of the staff would himself guide the
leading column. Returning to my staff, I gave the
necessary orders, and tried to get some sleep, but I
could not, as one alarming thought followed upon
another. Should we succeed in reaching height
No. so-and-so? What if the enemy suddenly fell
upon our rear from Chang-chia-tun, or our flank
from Shih-san-li-tai, or the surrounding country
(all was quite possible)? It was doubtful if we could
make good our retreat to our positions at Nan Shan,
the more so, as the road from Chang-chia-tun to
Chin-chou had been left absolutely unprotected by
us. These thoughts were justifiable in view of the
fact that the enemy had landed from forty transports
north of Terminal Point, under our very
noses, and, supposing there was a battalion in each,
that meant forty battalions to our eleven or
twelve.</p>

<p>At 2 a.m. I got up. Every one was sound asleep.
Reaching the men’s bivouacs, I saw them served out
with a pound of meat and a large quantity of bread;
they had no tea, as orders had been given that fires
were not to be lighted, and from this it was clear
that General Fock expected a brush with the enemy.
About 3 a.m. the battalions stood to arms, but, as it
happened, there was some delay, and the chief of
the staff did not turn up until 5 o’clock, when we
at last made a start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>I was put in command of a detachment consisting
of the two battalions of the 5th Regiment and a
battery under Lieutenant-Colonel Romanovski. We
started off well enough, but the trouble was that the
horse of the chief of the staff was a particularly good
one, and the column fell considerably behind him;
the country was very intersected and covered by a
regular network of roads, and very bad ones at that.
The chief of the staff, leading the way with his map,
forgot to leave guides at the cross-roads, the result
being that the column stopped when it came to a
cross-road, not knowing which direction to take.
We lost a lot of time owing to these halts, but we
nevertheless preserved the right direction. (I do
not mention the order of march, as that was as usual:
skirmishers, advanced guard with mounted scouts,
and main body.)</p>

<p>To the north and north-west was our screen of
scouts, and as they constantly showed themselves on
the skyline we kept wondering: “Are not these
the enemy’s scouts?” Two hours had already passed
since we started, and we had gone down into a wide
valley, when Lieutenant-Colonel Bielozor, commanding
the 2nd Battalion, came up to me and drew my
attention to the peculiar movements of our artillery.
Instead of following us, it had moved off to a height
lying on the left flank of our line of march; behind
it was a chain of skirmishers from the rear of our
column, and behind this line compact companies.
Not understanding its doings, I galloped up to the
battery, and in the midst of the moving columns,
unaccompanied by his staff, I saw General Fock.
I had hardly got up to him, when he shouted to me:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
“What kind of a company commander have you
got? See how he lets that battery get in front of
him; he is a perfect fool! Such officers are a curse
to us!” I answered that I would overtake the
company at once, but I wished to know what was
happening, as the battery under my command was
going off somewhere, and I had not been informed of
it. “That is its right position,” answered the general,
pointing to the hill the artillery were making for.
“Then we are going to stop there?” “No,” replied
General Fock; “we are going on farther under
cover of this battery.”</p>

<p>I then saw that, far ahead of the battery, our
dense columns were advancing, apparently attacking
some one. The regiment advancing on the left of
my column had sent out a line of skirmishers to the
flank on one side of our advance, and I learnt that
they had noticed a hostile column in a hollow on
our left flank. It turned out that this was a company
of that regiment which had advanced on Shih-san-li-tai
from the south, and occupied the position covering
Chin-chou from the Shih-san-li-tai side.</p>

<p>“Form a reserve for the attackers, and with one
company occupy the hill towards which the head of
your column is moving,” ordered General Fock. I
galloped off to comply with this order.</p>

<p>This advance went on for an hour. We occupied
a succession of positions, but it was very noticeable
that our men did not take full advantage of the
ground, but rather tried not to lose touch with each
other. It was all right when the officers were actually
keeping them together, but what would happen
when they were not there to do so? Our men are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
not accustomed to act on their own initiative, and
a long skirmishing line does not permit of the officers
directing their men by voice and example. It was
lucky that we were the defenders and not the
attackers!</p>

<p>While occupied with these thoughts, I heard the
“assembly” sounded by our buglers; our men
remained where they were, but the commanders
hurried off to the general, who had called them by
this signal. The enemy had not been encountered;
he was at Chang-chia-tun, or perhaps to the north
of Shih-san-li-tai. The operation had been thought
out in great detail by the general. For me it was
remarkable in that we had manœuvred under the
enemy’s very nose, while contemptuously leaving
him also in the rear. After a short halt we returned
to the position with the men singing loudly.<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>After this expedition we received an order which
brought home to me the exactness with which General
Fock gauged the situation. His directions were
clear and fully conformed to the real state of affairs.
Here are some characteristic paragraphs of the order:
“God save us from those commanders who wait
for orders in the heat of battle: they won’t
get any given them, so let them get that idea out
of their heads.” Or: “I ask all company and battalion
commanders, as soon as they meet the enemy,
to raise their heads, open their eyes, and keep their
ears shut. Believe me, your eyes are everything: your
ears won’t help you much, though, unfortunately,
this is not a generally accepted idea. Even an old
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>captain of twenty-two years’ service will, during
manœuvres, begin to prick up his ears like a hare
so as to catch some order from his commander;
but his commander is dead, or is himself engaged
with something else.” These golden rules are worthy
of a place in every book on tactics, and in all regulations
on the general direction of an action.</p>

<p>Immediately after our return our scouts brought
us news that the enemy was near Shih-san-li-tai
station in small numbers, and massed on the shores
of the bay, a little to the south of Chang-chia-tun.
This was about May 11, and from this time onward
our scouts had daily skirmishes with the enemy.</p>

<p>General Fock remained true to his decision to
meet the enemy in front of the Nan Shan position.
We only roughly knew the enemy’s strength, so he
decided to carry out another reconnaissance in force,
and again moved his forces forward to the villages
of Chang-chia-tun and Shih-san-li-tai, and thus
blocked the line of the enemy’s advance southward
along the Pu-lan-tien and Nan Shan road. All
the regiments of the 4th Rifle Division, except the
15th, were employed; our eight companies were in
the advanced guard; the 3rd and 4th at Shih-san-li-tai,
and the 6th and 8th, and the 3rd Scout Detachment
at Chang-chia-tun, our 3rd Battalion being
placed in the interval between these two detachments.
The positions to be occupied by us were
well studied beforehand. The companies moved
out and took up their positions. On the night of
May 15, and the morning of the 16th, other troops
with guns moved off, two batteries were placed
near the railway bridge on the road to Pi-tzu-wo,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and one (Romanovski’s) with the regimental half-battery
under Second-Lieutenant Sadykov on the
hills above Shih-san-li-tai. After our battalions
had occupied their positions an order came from
General Fock that our 3rd Battalion, under the command
of Colonel Dounin, was to return to the position.
In order not to give the enemy a chance of working
round behind us, I was ordered to move the 7th
Company and the scout detachment with Lieutenant
Naoomov’s two guns through the space between the
shore of Kerr Bay and Mount Sampson to the old
Chinese fortifications, and to form half the 9th Company
as a reserve to the 7th, but I myself was left
on the position with three companies.</p>

<p>At daybreak on May 16 I went to Battery No. 13,<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and had an excellent view of the engagement<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and
the movements of our troops. Our companies and
guns were already in position on the left flank. The
other regiments were moving round towards the
foot of Mount Sampson in a south-westerly direction,
and the head of the column had just reached the hill,
when heavy rifle fire broke out, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Romanovski’s and the bullock battery on
the left began to speak. In five minutes the fire
of these batteries had become awful, and thick
smoke completely hid them from my view (this smoke
was caused by bursting Japanese shells). After
half an hour, when the tail of our main column had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>passed Mount Sampson, the batteries on the right
flank opened fire. Firing continued for an hour
from both flanks, and we followed the course of the
fight most intently. I was very much afraid that
the enemy would try to get round our rear, but the
7th Company was silent, and its commander reported
that no movement was noticeable in his front. The
fire on the left flank began to slacken, and carts
and stretchers were seen moving from that direction.
Half an hour later I noticed Romanovski’s battery
on the road from Shih-san-li-tai, followed by our
bullock battery, both moving towards us at a
walk. An orderly from the left flank came up
and reported that we were retreating, but he had
not seen the Japanese infantry, having only observed
that the Japanese had swept our battery with shells,
thereby silencing it and compelling it to retreat behind
the hill. At the same moment that the batteries
on the left flank moved, I saw that the reserves
had occupied a shoulder of Mount Sampson facing
the village of Shih-san-li-tai. Dense lines of skirmishers
quietly lay on the crest of this ridge, allowing
the guns, and subsequently the skirmishers of our left
flank, to pass through them. From this I concluded
that the enemy was pressing our right and that
General Fock thought that we could not hold our
ground, and had, therefore, strengthened his left
flank, which had, so far, not been assailed by the
Japanese. After another hour had passed, our
retreating lines came into view from behind Mount
Sampson, and the guns near the railway bridge
opened a terrific fire. The rifle and gun fire behind
Mount Sampson continued, now weaker, now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
stronger, till at last the lines of reserves, passing
through the left flank, quickly collected and began
to retreat on our position. I expected to see the
Japanese in pursuit, but none appeared. At last
the batteries on the right flank retired and our companies
followed in their wake, but still the Japanese
did not pursue. It was now that I saw a picture
of a truly wonderful retreat, in which our men
marched in column as at manœuvres. The left flank
had already reached our position, when General
Nadyein came in wounded in the hand, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Romanovski with a wound in the
leg. The situation naturally gave rise to a good
deal of questioning and surmise. It appears that
Second-Lieutenant Sadykov, who commanded our
bullock battery, had himself gone to the assistance
of Lieutenant-Colonel Romanovski and commanded
his half-battery to the end of the engagement.</p>

<p class="hang small">Further account of the actions at Chang-chia-tun and Shih-san-li-tai—Preliminary
skirmishes round Chin-chou—The battle of Nan Shan, May 26, 1904.</p>

<p class="noindent">Our regiments went on to Ta-fang-shen, while the
enemy’s troops found themselves facing the Nan Shan
position, all ready and prepared to meet them with
a hail of shell and bullets. However, they did not
show themselves as yet, and everything retained
its usual aspect. On the night of May 17 it was
reported at the advanced posts that the enemy had
occupied the pass near the railway bridge and was
forcing back our advanced detachments with small
bodies of infantry, a cross fire being kept up all
that night. Next, a report came in from the left
flank to the effect that the enemy was pressing the
outpost line on that side; in proof of which a few
wounded were brought in. It thus became evident
that the Japanese were drawing closer round the
Nan Shan position. Reports received in the morning
made it clear that the Japanese had occupied
all the heights lying in front of the Nan Shan position
and were engaged in fortifying themselves on them.
We could not, however, see any definite signs of
them, as they were careful not to venture out from
the shelter of the hills in front, save that towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
midday we were able to locate earth-works on
the hill near Shih-san-li-tai about 7 versts from
our position. On closer examination we discerned
certain works somewhat nearer, which were without
doubt infantry trenches, and on which our long-range
guns immediately opened fire. Our shells
did not reach the more distant line, but at once
succeeded in stopping work on the nearer trenches.
Fire on the enemy’s works was kept up, off and on,
all that day.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that one regiment was insufficient
to defend the whole position, as well as the
ground lying to the front of it, I asked General Fock
to send me two infantry scout detachments from the
13th and 14th Regiments. My request being granted,
the outpost line, on the following night, consisted
of four infantry detachments and one mounted. All
this night a cross fire was kept up with the Japanese
posts, which pressed our men so hard that I had to
strengthen the line on the right flank by a half-company
(supplied by No. 2 Company). Our
outpost line ran as follows: from the shores of Chin-chou
Bay to the town wall of Chin-chou, with patrols
out to some distance in advance of the wall, from
the town to Nan Shan railway station, and from there
to Hand Bay. During the night the Japanese drove
us out of the old Chinese fortifications beyond Kerr
Bay, inflicting some losses—a few killed and many
wounded. Our opponents threw out such a strong
screen that our men were not able to penetrate it at
any point so as to see what they were doing behind,
and, as we were thus left in complete ignorance as
to their numbers and dispositions, I had to be guided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
by the knowledge gained at the time of the action
of Chang-chia-tun, which information I cannot do
better than give in the words of Lieutenant-Colonel
Saifoolin, who commanded a portion of our right
flank, and from whom I had the following story of
the engagement:</p>

REGIMENT.</p>
    <p class="x-small left">p. 34]</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Our companies were disposed in the following
order: I, with the 8th Company, occupied a hill
near a ruined tower on the left side of the nullah
along which runs the road to Godzarlin; the 6th
Company occupied the crest on the right side of
this nullah; and the 3rd Scout Detachment, under
Captain Koudriavtsev, occupied a hill on the extreme
right flank of the line and somewhat in front of the
6th Company. The mounted scouts were sent out
in front as skirmishers. Hardly had day broken,
when our scouts reported that the enemy was moving
in considerable force along the road from Godzarlin
and nearer; following hard upon this report there
came in view, in front of out right flank, dense
Japanese lines, with their left flank resting on Mount
Sampson, and firing commenced at once at very
long range. The enemy did not hurry in his advance,
but developed such a terrific rifle fire that a great
number of our men were placed <i>hors de combat</i>.
Not having any companies in reserve, I sent for help
to a battalion of the 14th Regiment, which was
formed up in our rear, and one company of this
battalion (commanded by Suvorov), posted by itself
behind our right flank, started to move up to us,
but halted and commenced firing without joining
our line. This continued for an hour, during which
time the enemy’s troops advanced without check
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
until they were 400 paces, or less, from our
scouts and the 6th Company; their strength
being about fifteen companies. Meanwhile about
forty Japanese companies were turning our left
flank. Our losses in the 6th Company and among
the scouts were already considerable. In the former
the commander was wounded and the sergeant-major
and thirty men were killed; while of the
latter about one-half were <i>hors de combat</i>, including
the commander. Not seeing any sign of reinforcements,
we sent to ask what was to be done. At
this time the enemy began to turn our right flank
also. No one came to our assistance, our companies
were melting away, and the enemy was continuing
to advance. I gave the order to retire, and, under
a terrific fire, we got back almost to the railway
bridge, where our artillery covered us, opening such
a deadly fire on the enemy’s lines that they came
to a standstill and then took cover in the folds of the
ground. The order was then given for a general
retreat, whereupon we retired behind the town and
ultimately to the main position.”</p>

<p>At Shih-san-li-tai, on the left flank, a fearful
artillery fight took place with rather disastrous
results for us. In Romanovski’s battery all the
officers were put out of action, and he himself was
wounded, as were also nearly all the men of the gun
detachments, so that there was no one to bring up
ammunition, and volunteers from the 3rd Company
had to be called for. Things reached such a pass
that Romanovski himself loaded a gun; the adjutant
of the brigade, who had been sent off with an order,
was killed by a shell. But the enemy not being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
strong in infantry on that flank, did not press an
advance, so that our losses in the 12th Company
were only four men, and in the 3rd but a few more.<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>There seems to have been some misunderstanding
about this retreat. The following day I went to the
divisional headquarters with my report, and, while
there, General Fock sent for General Nadyein, who
commanded the detachment engaged at Shih-san-li-tai.<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>“Why did you retire?” said General Fock,
turning to him.</p>

<p>“On your order, your Excellency,” replied General
Nadyein.</p>

<p>“What order? I never gave any order.”</p>

<p>General Nadyein thereupon produced a note,
signed by Lieutenant-Colonel Romanovski, in which
it was clearly stated that General Fock had himself
ordered the retreat. Lieutenant-Colonel Romanovski,
having been sent for, stated that General Fock had
actually ordered him to write the note. General
Fock was quite at a loss to understand this, but gave
orders that for the future, on important occasions,
only orders signed by him in person were to be obeyed.</p>

<p>On May 21 General Stessel came out to the position.
He was apparently very dissatisfied with the
result of the late engagement, and when he heard
that Major Gomsiakov, the commander of the 6th
Company, had been left wounded on the field of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
battle, his displeasure knew no bounds; he addressed
the 6th Company in severe terms, removed the next
senior officer, Captain Sichev, from the command
of the company, and said that he was not to be
recommended for any reward.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, neither the company nor the
officer was at all deserving of this rebuke. Major
Gomsiakov had been taken away in a Chinese cart,
and subsequently a horse had been procured for him
on which to ride to the dressing station. Being,
however, unable to mount, an ambulance wagon
was sent for, but meanwhile he sent back the men
who had brought him, saying that they were needed
in the firing line, and he awaited the arrival of the
wagon with a soldier of the Medical Corps. About
this time the retreat commenced, and Major Gomsiakov
gave his sword to the man and told him to go
away, saying: “You can’t help me, and if you remain
they will kill you, and perhaps they want you in
your company.” Major Gomsiakov was taken prisoner
by the Japanese, and died from his wounds.</p>

<p>The engagements at Shih-san-li-tai and Chang-chia-tun
cost us about 100 men in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Having inspected the position, General Stessel
went on to Chin-chou, which was already being
attacked by the enemy from the northern side.
When we rode into the gates bullets had begun to
whistle along the streets, but the general, having
gone as far as the old Chinese temple, turned back
and reached the position again without hurt.</p>

<p>Our men slept in the trenches and batteries, the
outpost line consisting of a screen of scouts and a
line of sentries detailed from the companies occupying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the trenches. I dreaded a night attack, which
might very well be successful owing to our lack of
defenders, and I was the more afraid because the
enemy did not hurry himself, but seemed to be
minutely studying the defences. We thus had to
be keenly on the alert.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of May 22 we heard heavy
rifle fire opening under the walls of the town.<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> We
could not see the enemy from the position, but the
town commandant informed me by telephone
that the Japanese were preparing for an assault.
I had no fear of the town being taken, since we had
400 men there and had filled sixty sand-bags with
powder ready to explode when the enemy got close to
the walls. Besides this, at the request of the commandant,
I had reinforced the garrison with half the
9th Company under its commander, Major Sokolov.
Though it would be impracticable to take the town
without a heavy artillery preparation, it would be
quite feasible to pass round it and proceed to attack
the adjoining position from the right flank. So we
quietly followed the course of the action and watched
for targets for our artillery, but none appeared.
The first attack on the town was beaten back easily,
but the enemy effected a lodgment on the north-western
side, where he was completely covered
by the town wall from fire from the direction of
the position. From this time the rattle of rifle fire
round the town did not cease. As an advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>point of the position the town certainly began to
fulfil its intended rôle in the operations.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that we did not take steps
with a view to the stubborn defence of the Nan
Shan position. Even assuming that such determined
defence was risky, as the enemy’s troops could effect
a landing to the south of the position, and so cut
us off from Port Arthur, they would, on the other
hand, have had to run considerable risk themselves
in landing under our very eyes. They had, indeed,
already thrown considerable forces against us from
the north, and it would, perhaps, have been difficult
for them to have sent another force (about two
divisions) against the Port Arthur garrison. Therefore,
I say with the greatest assurance that, had we
decided to defend the Nan Shan position stubbornly
and had armed our batteries with heavy guns, supplementing
our guns of position with, say, a brigade
of field artillery, we should have held the enemy
before Nan Shan for a long time and perhaps have
compelled him to have recourse to sapping operations.
During the time thus gained, the garrison of the
fortress would have been enabled to put its works
into a better state of defence than that in which
they actually were left in consequence of lack of
time.</p>

<p>The enemy made constant assaults on the town,
but always without success.<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Once the Japanese
sappers brought up a huge charge of gun-cotton to
the gates, but our marksmen killed those who tried
to place it, and brought the charge into the town.
Continuing his operations, the enemy placed a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>battery on the slopes of the hills overlooking the
town, and fortified the heights near Shih-san-li-tai.
The care displayed in doing this surprised us. We
tried to impede the work by fire, but the range
was far too great for our guns.</p>

<p>On the evening of May 22, a 6-inch Schneider-Canet
gun was brought on to the position, and I
decided to place it in the central redoubt, where
it would command the bays on both flanks. Starting
at once to get it into its allotted position, a whole
company worked day and night on the 23rd and
24th mounting the gun, and on the 25th it was just
ready to be placed on its carriage, when a heavy
bombardment commenced and greatly hindered the
work.</p>

<p>From the time of our retreat from the positions
at Shih-san-li-tai and Chang-chia-tun to the Nan
Shan position we hardly had a moment’s peace;
constant small night affairs in the outpost line, and
the nightly expectation of a big attack, compelled
us to have half our men on the alert. I never once
undressed, or took off my boots; messages kept on
coming in, and hardly gave me a chance of closing
my eyes. Such was the strain that we were quite
worn out.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th the enemy began a
terrific bombardment. We were all at our posts,
and replied with heavy artillery fire, suffering, however,
little damage during this bombardment; none
of our guns were touched, though it was impossible
to work at mounting our big gun of position. We
had several hit, including Boochatski, commanding
the 11th Company, who was severely wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>I must mention an incident with a kite. Why it
was brought on to the position, I do not know, as
we could observe the movements of the enemy perfectly
from the top of our hill, and without incurring
the risk of being dashed to the ground. The party
who brought it, with Mr. Kourelov, a very brave
man, decided to fly it at the very height of the bombardment.
The kite reached a great altitude, and,
of course, immediately attracted the attention of
the Japanese, with the result that a hail of shrapnel
burst over the heads of the daring detachment,
and, to avoid unnecessary losses, I ordered them to
bring the kite down. Thank God! neither a man of
the detachment nor Mr. Kourelov was touched.</p>

<p class="noindent center p2"><span class="smcap bold">The Battle of Nan Shan</span><a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>I spent the night of the 25th–26th with my adjutant
and orderly officer on Battery No. 13 in a bomb-proof,
which was placed high up, but nevertheless
capable of protecting us from the enemy’s field-artillery
fire. Everything was quiet in the evening,
but at about midnight the enemy began to move;
our outposts reported that they heard guns moving,
and our posts on the right flank were driven back by
advancing infantry. The weather was shocking—it
was pouring with rain and there was thunder in the
air. Foreseeing that the enemy would make an attack
on our right flank and, if successful, would surround
the town, and not wishing to make him a present of
the four hundred men in it, who were indispensable
to me on the position, I sent an order to
the commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Yermeiev, not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>to allow himself to be surrounded, but to retreat from
the town on to the position while the southern gates
were free, and to man the trenches on our left flank.
The enemy attacked the town about 3 a.m., but,
being unsuccessful, began to surround it, when the
commandant passed out through the south gate and
fought his way back to the position. One section,
which was late in getting through the gate, jumped
down from the wall, a height of 9 feet, and effected
its retreat. But in the darkness the men did not
reach the positions to which they had been assigned,
and, instead of the whole of the 10th Company, only
two sections, under Second-Lieutenant Merkoulev,
reached the point they had been ordered to defend.
The remaining half-company,<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> under Major Goosov,
and half of No. 9 Company, under Major Sokolov,
occupied the empty trenches near Redoubt No. 8.
Some of the 3rd Scout Detachment occupied the lower
tier of trenches of this redoubt, but the majority of
them got to their proper positions on the left flank.</p>

<p>Our dispositions were as follows: the 2nd Company
held the extreme right flank from No. 2 Redoubt;
the 2nd Scout Detachment was near the railway
and in Redoubt No. 1; the corner beyond was unoccupied;
the 12th Company was near the quarry,
and the 3rd farther on in the trenches; behind them
the 8th and 4th Companies and the 1st Scout Detachment,
and the 6th Company in Redoubt No. 8;
farther behind the ravine were the 5th, 7th, and half
the 10th Companies; and towards the shores of
Chin-chou Bay two Scout Detachments of the 13th
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and 14th Regiments were in trenches. Near No. 15
Battery were the 3rd Company 14th Regiment, and a
section of our 7th Company; the ground between
the scout detachments and No. 15 Battery was
absolutely undefended. Four machine guns under
Second-Lieutenant Lobyrev were at the disposal of
the 7th Company on the cliffs near the shore, and
four naval machine guns, under Midshipman Shimanski,
were placed behind our 1st Scout Detachment.
The forts inside the position, which could have been
fought individually, and so have increased the obstinacy
of the defence, were without defenders: the
central redoubt, Battery No. 13, and many trenches
were absolutely unoccupied for want of men. I had
in the reserve the 11th Company 5th Regiment, and
two companies of the 13th Regiment, while I had
detached the following officers to command sections
of the position: right flank up to No. 1 Battery,
Major Stempnevski; the centre—12th, 3rd, 8th,
and 4th Companies;—Lieutenant-Colonel Bielozor;
left flank—6th Company, 1st Scout Detachment,
5th and 7th Companies, and the whole of the left
flank—Lieutenant-Colonel Saifoolin. The artillery
consisted of guns placed in fifteen batteries, as on
<a href="#map_1">Map I.</a>; No. 1 Battery being armed with eight
8·7-cm. field guns.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>From daybreak on the 26th the enemy began to
bombard the position; and shells flew thick and
fast, more especially on No. 13. When it was light
enough, I looked at the enemy through my glasses.
His batteries extended in an unbroken line from
Chin-chou Bay to Hand Bay, and some batteries—apparently
of heavy guns—stood on the slopes of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
hills behind the town. The enemy did not husband
his ammunition. Four gunboats, and perhaps
destroyers with them, came close inshore in Chin-chou
Bay, and two large ships lay near the entrance
to the bay in the rear of our position. These ships
fired very heavy shell. There was no sign yet of the
enemy’s infantry, but the gun fire was so terrific
as to compel us to retire into our bomb-proofs.
Near by stood a bucket of water; being afraid of its
being blown to bits, I ordered it to be placed under
cover, and one of the men had just reached it,
when a shrapnel burst close to him, and the water
poured out over the floor, Bombardier Ptooski being
wounded in the head, and I myself getting a scratch
on my leg. As the shelter was filled with smoke, we
found some difficulty in breathing in it, and the
majority of us therefore went out into the redoubt.
From there I saw the lines of the enemy’s skirmishers
round our right flank; our 4th and 8th Companies
had opened fire, but the lines nevertheless advanced
slowly on us, leaving on the ground behind them small
black dots. Our fire was apparently very effective;
we had not measured all our ranges in vain. At eight
o’clock a large ship appeared in the bay on our own
right flank; “Well,” I thought, “the 2nd Company
will be able to reach her.” Imagine my joy when I
saw that she was firing on the enemy and I recognized
our <i>Bobr</i>, though, unfortunately, she did not keep
up firing for long, but put out to sea again. It was
about 9 a.m. when the enemy’s skirmishing line was
seen near Nan Shan station and behind the mounds
close to the nearest villages, right in front of all the
companies from the 2nd to the 8th. The rifle fire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
resolved itself into one continual rattle and roar. An
orderly from Lieutenant-Colonel Bielozor came to me
with a report, in which he had written as follows:</p>

<p>“The enemy is in front of us and is attacking,
but do you know that there are 700 yards of trenches
near us absolutely unoccupied? We must have help.”</p>

<p>I myself saw that the Japanese were directing
their attack on our 8th Company. The line had
come to a standstill before all the other companies,
so I sent half of the 11th Company to the threatened
point. At this time I had three companies in reserve,
the 11th of my own regiment, and two companies of
the 13th. The enemy’s companies got up to the
wire entanglements in front of the 8th and 4th Companies,
but, finding their advance barred, they retired
in disorder, taking cover in the folds of the ground and
thence opening a tremendous fire. I was now certain
that we had nothing to fear from the Japanese infantry.
Just then another orderly arrived from Lieutenant-Colonel
Bielozor, asking for immediate reinforcements,
but, having already sent him half the 11th
Company, I felt sure that that was sufficient. At
this moment the enemy’s skirmishing line in front
of the 2nd Company occupied the southern extremities
of a small village, and as this place afforded excellent
cover, I saw that there was a danger of the enemy
collecting considerable forces behind it and overwhelming
the 2nd Company, the more so, as it
was only 400 paces from the village to the
position. On seeing, however, that such an attack
would be taken in flank by the fire of the 2nd Company,
I felt somewhat easier. The enemy’s infantry
was now spread out round the whole position in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
semicircle, like his artillery, and the crackle of rifle
fire was absolutely incessant. Besides this, we saw
that the troops composing his right flank had gone
down into the water in the Bay of Chin-chou and
were effecting a turning movement through the
water; but this advance was checked after the
lapse of a few moments by our gun and rifle fire (at
very long ranges, however). In all probability the men
of this column were nearly all killed, as no movement
could be detected among the Japanese bodies lying in
the water—all were still.<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The enemy’s skirmishers
kept closing in and then again retiring; but meanwhile
our men, after beating back the infantry attack,
suffered severely from artillery fire. I received word
that Lieutenant-Colonel Radetski had been killed.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock the commander of the 6th
Company reported to me that his advanced trench
was completely wrecked by artillery fire from the sea
and from the front, and that it was impossible to
obtain any cover in it. This was grave news. I
noticed considerable movement among the enemy’s
troops before our left flank, and a mass of men began
to move from the centre to the left flank. The troops
of the enemy’s right flank, which had been sitting
in the water of Chin-chou Bay for some time, began
to move forward. To defend this (left) flank I had:
the 7th Company, half of the 10th Company, the
larger half of the 3rd Scout Detachment of our regiment
(the remainder had retreated into the trenches
near No. 8 Redoubt), two Scout Detachments of the
13th and 14th Regiments, under the command of
Lieutenants Bandaletov and Roosoi, and near No. 15
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>Battery the 3rd Company of the 14th Regiment,
under Captain Ushakov, with one section of the 7th
Company. We had sufficient men to beat back
an attack, but the losses of the 5th Company had
caused me some anxiety. In order, therefore, to
reinforce the 5th Company, I sent the remaining half
of the 11th Company into the trenches to the left of
No. 8 Redoubt, so as to enfilade the troops of the
enemy attacking the 5th Company, and earlier still I
had sent Captain Rotaiski’s company into a so-called
deep trench near by. These measures were sufficient
to prevent the enemy from breaking through at the
point held by the 5th Company. I built great
hopes on our four machine guns, posted behind
the 7th Company’s left flank (see <a href="#Page_43">page 43</a>).
They constituted a tremendous power, practically
equalling a whole company, and they were, moreover,
cleverly concealed in some small pits. I immediately
sent in a report. (I had forwarded reports
of everything that had taken place on the field and
also the reports of the different commanders.)</p>

<p>About twelve o’clock the enemy’s rifle fire
suddenly ceased, and his artillery also grew silent.
Taking advantage of this, I went down to the
road from No. 13 Battery to meet two gunners
coming from the position. We noticed General
Fock and his adjutant on the road. Major Visoki
reported that the gunners had suffered severely, and
that the ammunition supply was exhausted. As
they had no rifles, I sent them away from the position,
and thus, from twelve o’clock, we were left without
artillery. Just before this sudden temporary cessation
of fire I had already noticed from the hill how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
our artillery fire was dying down and how cruelly the
enemy’s shells blew our gunners to pieces; indeed,
the helplessness of our guns became apparent as
soon as the enemy’s cannonade commenced.</p>

<p>It is impossible to imagine what such a fire is like.
An unceasing stream of shells burst over each battery
and over No. 13 Battery, where it was only possible
to sit right up against the earth-work, now and then
venturing to glance over it to observe what was
going on. When the fire had become positively
fiendish we took cover in the upper bomb-proof, a
relic of the Chinese war. It gave us sufficient cover
from small shell, and it was possible to write there,
send reports, and receive reports from orderlies, but
the fire from the ships made us fear for our safety.
A single shell would have been sufficient to bury us all
under the ruins of our shelter. All the ravines were
literally pitted with shell splinters. Our unfortunate
artillery was so occupied in its struggle with the
enemy’s guns that it paid no attention to the ships
threatening the fortifications on our left flank. However,
this was not surprising, as the batteries did not
themselves feel the fire of the enemy’s ships.
From their front guns roared also, so from a feeling
of self-preservation they returned that fire at first as
energetically as they could. The order I had sent
to No. 4 Battery to direct its fire on the enemy’s ships
had evidently not got through to the battery commander.
Our fire began to slacken, and finally ceased,
owing to losses and, in many batteries, for want of
ammunition. In No. 9 Battery every man was
killed but one, and he continued to fire by himself
from each gun in rotation. He loaded the guns in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
turn and fired them until a shell put an end to this
hero. In spite of all my efforts I have been unable
to learn his name. “Peace to your ashes, unknown
hero, the pride and glory of your regiment!”<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The greater number of our guns was unharmed,
though two pieces in the centre of the position were
dismounted, as were also all the guns of No. 15
Battery, against which the enemy’s ships were firing.</p>

<p>A deathlike stillness now reigned along the whole
position for an hour. Going down to the lower line
of trenches, I tried to get to General Fock, who had
been seen, as I have said, on the road to No. 10
Battery, but he had gone off somewhere, and I did
not see him again; possibly he went along the
ravines to Ta-fang-shen station.</p>

<p>Soldiers of the 5th Company who had fallen to
the rear said that it had gone badly with that company,
and that it had vacated the advanced trench
and occupied No. 9 Redoubt and the ravines near it.
The men in all the other trenches and forts gallantly
stuck to their posts. After an hour of silence, firing
began again, rifles cracked, and guns roared. I
went to my observing station. The enemy literally
swept us with a hail of shrapnel. One shell burst
right over the heads of two of my orderlies standing
behind me, killing one outright and wounding the
other in the head. A short time after, our small-arm
ammunition magazine near No. 10 Battery caught fire.</p>

<p>Soon after there were some distressing signs of
disorder on the left flank (the section defended by
the 5th Company)—men were retiring and going
back, without stopping, to the rear of the position;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>but I received no report from the commander of the
5th Company. I then noticed that the enemy’s fire
was concentrated on the 5th and 7th Companies.
Though I had foreseen an attack on these points I
was not afraid that the enemy would break through
there, as Rotaiski’s company and Redoubt No. 8,
with its trenches, made it impracticable. Nevertheless,
I felt the need of a larger reserve, and I reported
to General Fock that I should have no men with
which to renew the battle if the enemy should beat
us back out of our advanced positions. I earnestly
asked for reinforcements; but General Fock, guided,
I suppose, by the general supposition that reinforcements
are always asked for before they are needed,
and thinking, perhaps, that I was making mountains
out of molehills, did not pay any attention to my
request, or else did not wish to satisfy it, and our
position became critical. Our scouts on the left
flank, as also the 5th and 7th Companies, were
demoralized, especially the 5th.</p>

<p>Captain Lubeemov’s company of the 13th Regiment,
which was with me in the reserve, had disappeared
somewhere, so that Captain Teemoshenko, who was
sent by me to take it to the place where I had decided
it should go (on the left flank, in the interval between
our 7th Company and Captain Ushakov’s company,
near No. 15), could not find it, and came back. Thus
I now had not a single company under my hand.<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Afterwards it became known that Lubeemov’s company
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>had received by an orderly an order purporting
to come from me, and had taken up a position near
our 5th and 7th Companies on the left flank. It
had failed to reach its <i>correct</i> position (see <a href="#Page_50">last
page</a>), as no one was there to direct it. I do not,
however, blame Captain Lubeemov; he had obeyed his
orders, but went to the right, instead of the left, flank
of Captain Ushakov. Captain Teemoshenko should
have pointed out the right place, but he failed to find
the company. Where Captain Lubeemov was wrong,
was in altering his position without my orders.</p>

<p>Shortly after, about four o’clock, an officer came up
and reported that the 6th and 7th Companies of the
14th Regiment were coming to my assistance. I
received a note from General Fock, in which he
ordered me to use these companies only to cover a
retreat, and not to employ them in the trenches.
Then I understood that General Fock was not going
to help me to hold the position, which he might have
done without much difficulty, since I only required
one additional battalion in reserve.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Bielozor now sent to ask for
reinforcements. Although I could see no attack on
his side, in view of the urgency of the request, and
so as to be quite safe on our right flank (where an
adjoining village was strongly held by the Japanese,
and the railway embankment could screen large
numbers of the enemy), I decided to send half a
company of the 14th Regiment under Captain
Kousmin, an excellent officer, well known to me.</p>

<p>About six o’clock bullets began to whistle over our
heads in No. 13, and, my trumpeter being wounded,
I took him myself into the bomb-proof to be attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to. On the left flank men in yellow jackets<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> were
moving about in groups, and five minutes had not
passed before Second-Lieutenant Sadykov came into
the shelter and reported that the left flank was retreating.
I rushed out and saw that the yellow-coats
were streaming up, and shrapnel bursting over the
7th and 5th Companies, while a heavy cross fire
was being kept up. The Japanese skirmishers had
lain down in their places and there was no warning of
their sudden advance. Seeing that our scouts were
retreating, and that all the others might retreat with
them, I, not having any orders to retreat from the
position, galloped off to the reserve and ordered the
one-and-a-half companies of the 14th Regiment, sent
by General Fock, to move against the Japanese appearing
near Work No. 10. As we rode down, we
came into a hot fire from the neighbouring hills.</p>

<p>I thought that I could arrest the retreat and
deliver a counter-attack from behind the reserve, and
then, having taken No. 10 Battery, re-organize the
left flank.</p>

<p>At the subsequent court-martial General Fock
declared that I could not have ordered the reserve
to meet the Japanese; but he was mistaken, being
misled by Captain Rotaiski, who, giving evidence,
declared that he saw the Japanese pursuing me and
saw me escape from them through the window of a
shed. I never got through any window, but I
mounted my horse and galloped off to stop those
retreating. The Japanese then fired on me from
the hills above the shed. It was not I, but a Japanese
officer, who jumped through the window, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>overtaken by four men from the reserve and killed
in the shed, as a proof of which his sword was presented
to the commander of the 14th Regiment.</p>

<p>The order to attack <i>was</i> given by me, for the commander
of the reserve rushed up to me and asked:
“What are we to do?” “Attack,” I answered,
and pointed out to him whom to attack and where.
After that I galloped after the retreating soldiers
and made myself hoarse shouting “Stop, stop, my
men!” But they in their turn shouted out to me:
“Your Excellency, we have been ordered to retreat.”
I could not imagine who had given this order. As,
however, at this moment the Japanese saw us
retreating from behind the Nan Shan hills, and
opened a terrific shrapnel fire, it was absolutely impossible
to stop the men. A shrapnel bullet struck
my mare’s ear and wellnigh maddened her. I managed
to rally my men in a position in rear, chosen
earlier by me, about a verst from the Nan Shan hills,
and when they had halted, I looked back towards
the hills and saw two bodies of men running down
into the valley; they were probably the 5th and 7th
Companies.</p>

<p>No. 13 was in the hands of the Japanese, who
were to be seen on the heights above, firing down on
the retreating men, who quickly hid themselves in
the deep ravines. I now occupied the above-mentioned
position in rear, brought up a battalion of
the 14th Regiment, and lengthened the line as far
as Ta-fang-shen station. I found the battalion in
question in a ravine behind the position. Of the
rest of the 14th Regiment I saw no signs; probably
they were somewhere in rear under cover. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
commander of our scouts came in to me here with
our colours.</p>

<p>Awaiting on this spot the enemy’s attack, we heard
heavy firing on the right of the Nan Shan position,
and the enemy’s guns ranged on us and on the right
flank. Our companies on that flank passed across
towards Ta-fang-shen, and I ordered them to concentrate
1 verst in rear of Ta-fang-shen on the road.
For some reason the Japanese decided not to attack
us. It was already quite dark when I went to the
burning station of Ta-fang-shen to see to the dispositions
of our troops there. Suddenly there was a
terrific explosion, and I was covered with fragments
of burning planks, beams, and hot bricks. How I and
my comrades escaped death passes my understanding.
The station was blown up at the instance of General
Fock’s staff—probably by his orders. One officer—Major
Saliarski—and twenty men were killed by
this senseless explosion.</p>

<p>Night had set in, when the 14th and 5th Regiments
received the order to retire, and I, leaving some
mounted patrols to watch the enemy’s movements,
went with the Mounted Scouts to Nan-kuan-ling.
While moving along the road, I met our 7th Company
and saw the whole of the 4th Division encamped
in the wide valley. There I found the
companies of the 5th Regiment which had retreated,
and ordered them to report their losses. Very
many of our comrades did not answer the roll-call,
the first return showing a loss in killed and
wounded of 75 officers and 1,500 men. It was
awful to see the thinned ranks of my gallant regiment;
my heart bled for my officers, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
brought up the rear in the retreat, but the spirit of
those left seemed to be as fine as ever. I feel bound
to pay tribute to our comrades who fell in the battle
and mention some of their heroic deeds.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Kragelski refused to retreat, and bade
each one of his men farewell as they passed him.
Captain Makoveiev, commanding the 8th Company,
had declared that he would never retreat, and he
was true to his word, for he remained in the trenches,
and was killed only when he had expended all the
cartridges in his revolver. Major Sokolov, commanding
the 9th Company, also refused to retreat, and
sabred several Japanese before being bayoneted to
death.</p>

<p>The whole of the left flank attributed the retirement
to the receipt of an order, and consequently I
set to work to sift the matter to the bottom. About
six o’clock General Fock sent an officer with the order
to retire. Though he did not come to me personally,
this officer probably sent an orderly—who failed to
reach me—and himself went to the left flank and conveyed
the order to retire to the scout detachments
of the 13th and 14th Regiments. This order reached
the commander of the 7th Company through Second-Lieutenant
Merkoulev, besides which the former saw
the orderly on a black horse shouting and waving
his sword towards the rear, and only then ordered
his company to retire. The fact that this order to retreat
was given, was confirmed by all the officers and
men, and also by Ensign Kaminar (5th Regiment).</p>

<p>I placed the letter sent to me by Lieutenant Sadykov
relating to this point before the commission
which assembled to investigate General Stessel’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
conduct. It was there shown that Second-Lieutenant
Moosalevski was present and heard General Fock
give the order to retreat to my orderly officer, Lieutenant
Glieb-Koshanski, who galloped back with the
orderly on the black horse to see the general’s order
carried out. When I stopped the retreating scouts,
Lieutenant Glieb-Koshanski and his orderly galloped
as far as the Nan Shan hills, and the latter reached
No. 10 Battery by a ravine when the Japanese were
already in the position (this hero never returned).
Our 7th Company and Captain Rotaiski’s company
were still at their posts, and began to retire only
after the receipt of the order.</p>

<p>When those who had been in Port Arthur were assembled
in St. Petersburg from all over the Empire
to give evidence at General Stessel’s trial, I only
gave details of the Nan Shan fight in answering the
questions put to me. The conclusion arrived at was
this: the scout detachments of the 14th Regiment,
shaken by the hasty retirement of those of the 13th
Regiment at that moment, began to abandon their
trenches about four o’clock, the time when I saw
them retreating in a body. Lieutenant Roosoi
had only ten men left in the trench, but the other
companies—<i>i.e.</i>, the 7th and 5th of our regiment,
and Captain Rotaiski’s company—remained on the
position. Lieutenant Glieb-Koshanski and the orderly
galloped up with a report to General Fock
just as I was leaving No. 13 and had mounted my
horse, and it was thus quite possible for the orderly
on the black horse to have really galloped up to the
position and given the order to retire before I had
stopped the retreating scouts. Anyway, it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
proved conclusively that the Japanese appeared
in No. 10 Battery, and the other inner works of the
position before the 7th and 5th Companies began
their retreat.</p>

<p>And it was in this way. When the Scout Detachment
of the 13th Regiment, under Second-Lieutenant
Bandaletov, and part of the Scouts of the 14th Regiment
began to retire (in consequence of the flanking
fire from the gunboats, and <i>not</i> because of the rifle
fire of the Japanese, whose skirmishers did not come
closer than 600 yards), the enemy, taking advantage
of natural cover, pursued them and, passing along
the ravines and watercourses, occupied the trenches
we had vacated, together with No. 10 Battery
and farther points. As, however, the Japanese were
not in great numbers, they could not break through
the centre, the 5th Company being in the deep
ravine, the 6th in No. 8 Redoubt, and Rotaiski’s
company in a deep valley. These companies could
not have let the Japanese pass, and I repeat that the
Japanese lines were in full view from where I was and
did not move until the scouts appeared in our rear.</p>

<p>From accounts given by officers, this is what
happened on the right flank. After the attack on
the 8th and 4th Companies had failed, the enemy
kept up a furious gun and rifle fire, but did not approach
our trenches. This continued until the retreat
of the 5th and 7th Companies had actually
begun. When the retreat of the left flank was
noticed from No. 8 Redoubt, and the Japanese
began to sweep our right flank from No. 5, Major
Goosov assembled all the officers there for a consultation
as to what should be done. After some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
hesitation it was decided to retreat; and word of
that decision was sent to other companies. However,
the 4th and 8th Companies, remembering the
order that there would be no retreat, refused to act
on the decision. Our gallant Colonel Bielozor
was in command, the company commanders being
Captain Shastin of the 4th Company, and Captain
Makoveiev of the 8th. On the retirement of the 6th
Company from No. 8 Redoubt, the 3rd, 4th, 8th,
and part of the 12th Companies, found themselves
in a hopeless position. There were Japanese in
their rear, Japanese machine guns on No. 5, and a
large body of Japanese in front, ready to attack,
which they soon did. Seeing their comrades on
the heights, where our batteries had been, and also
in No. 8 Redoubt, the enemy in front advanced to
the attack, but our gallant companies momentarily
stopped their desperate rush by a volley, which covered
the ground with hundreds of the enemy’s killed and
wounded. Then, facing round on the enemy who
was attacking their rear, they compelled him to take
cover behind the hills. The Japanese on the hill
signalled with white handkerchiefs to the companies
to surrender, but they only received volleys in reply.
Taking advantage of the indecisive action of the
Japanese in their rear, Lieutenant-Colonel Bielozor
decided to try and extricate his men from this unequal
fight, and gave the order to retire. Under
a heavy fire the men moved along the trenches to
the rear of the position, suffering severely from the
marksmen on the hills. In some places the men had
to come up out of the trenches, which were filled with
dead and dying, but eventually the companies succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in reaching No. 1 Battery. From that
point, too, Lieutenant-Colonel Bielozor and Captain
Shastin saw some Japanese columns trying to cut
off our companies retreating from the centre of the
position.</p>

<p>The enemy was advancing from the shores of
Hand Bay. Our brave officers at once thought of
covering our men by preventing this turning movement,
in spite of the enemy posted on the hills,
and to this end they collected their men, stopped
them, and opened volley fire on the Japanese.
The latter retaliated, and in their turn poured
in a hot fire from rifles and machine guns. This
fearful struggle continued for some time until not
a single one of our men was left alive. They all
fell in this unequal fight, defending themselves finally
not only with their bayonets, but even with their
fists. Lieutenant-Colonel Bielozor lost consciousness
from loss of blood, and fell; while Captain Shastin
also fell, dangerously wounded in the chest. Both
were picked up by the Japanese Red-Cross men,
and saved, thanks to a Japanese officer, who
gave orders that they were not to be killed.<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Our
right flank retreated simultaneously with our left
at the moment when the Japanese began to enfilade
them from the hills.</p>

<p>Having received the order to follow the regiment
to Nan-kuan-ling, I bivouacked with the 4th Rifle
Division, leaving my mounted scout detachment
there. This was at 10 or 11 p.m.</p>

<p>On my way I learnt from certain artillery officers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>that General Nadyein had, at the critical moment,
sent me two battalions (if only they had reached me!),
but that General Fock had ordered them to return.
At the court-martial this fact was not proved.</p>

<p>If, however, General Fock had decided to attack
the left flank of the enemy, where they were already
running out of shell and were engaged with our
companies, with even his two regiments, and had
brought up the whole of his artillery against this flank,
the enemy would, without doubt, have been checked
and the victory might have been on our side.</p>

<p>It is said that at the court-martial General Fock
stated that he wished to attack. What a pity that
this wish came too late!</p>

<p>One must watch for the first sign of wavering in
the soldier in order to be able to judge the proper
moment for throwing in the reserves, instead of
keeping them miles behind the firing line, as seems
necessary according to General Fock’s principle—“Keep
back your reserves as long as you possibly
can, as they are always asked for and sent up too
early.” That is all right as far as it goes, but at
the same time reserves must be used exactly at the
right moment. I understand the meaning of this
principle, but in order not to be misled in adopting
it, it is essential to follow the course of the action
very closely.</p>

<p>It was stated at the court-martial that the whole
of Lieutenant-Colonel Golitsinski’s battalion of the
14th Regiment was sent to the position, by General
Nadyein, but never reached it, occupying instead
the trenches made by me beyond Ta-fang-shen
on the seashore, in case the enemy tried to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
a turning movement through the water of Hand
Bay. This was more than a verst from the position,
in rear of its right flank. What they wanted a
battalion there for, I really do not understand. I
know nothing about this strange manœuvre, and I
never saw the battalion, but it would have played
a great part if I had had it with me in the centre.</p>

<p>There cannot be two commanders in one part of
a field of battle, and we had three—General Fock,
General Nadyein, and myself.</p>

<p class="noindent">I had hardly gone two versts from the bivouac,
when we heard firing behind us. A moment afterwards
a vague noise reached us, soon distinctly recognized
as the rumbling of a baggage wagon. In
another minute it had rattled past us at full speed.
Behind it galloped a field battery scattering or
destroying all that came in its way, and after
the battery came a hurtling mass of wagons, mounted
men, riderless horses, and unarmed men, and, to
make matters worse, somebody raised the alarming
cry of “Japanese cavalry! Japanese cavalry!”</p>

<p>The din and confusion were awful, and from the
bivouacs behind us shots and volleys were heard.
Together with the other officers near me I rushed
to the rear of the column to restore order. I also
ordered our band to strike up a march, and, thank
God, its martial strains restored confidence among
the fugitives—the noise ceased, and the men became
quite calm and collected.</p>

<p>The band played all the way to Nan-kuan-ling,<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
and we were saved further panics in consequence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>Having been shown where to bivouac, I sent to
the baggage train for bread, tea, and sugar, but alas!
the baggage was not to be found. What was to be
done? Our men had had neither food nor drink
all day. Tents and great-coats had been left on the
field of battle, so that the men had nothing but their
rifles and cartridges with them. We started to hunt
for food.</p>

<p>I sent, of course, to the railway station. We saw
through the window that all the rooms were packed
with officers of every regiment, and the staff of
the 4th Division was there too. Having forced my
way into the buffet, I approached Lieutenant-Colonel
Dmetrevski, the chief of staff of the 4th Division,
who, in answer to my question, “Where has our
baggage train been sent?” told me that it had been
sent straight into Port Arthur by General Fock’s
order, and he could not say where it was now. The
commanders of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Regiments
were there too. I asked the first of these for
200 poods<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> of bread, a quantity of which I saw
loaded up on some wagons standing close at
hand. In an hour we had unloaded them and distributed
the bread, each man getting about 4 lb.
I had a piece about that weight, as had also all the
other officers; of meat, there was absolutely none
to be had.</p>

<p>All available articles of food in the buffet had been
eaten before our arrival, but I succeeded in getting
some salt wherewith to flavour my bread.</p>

<p>Having slept for three hours on the bare ground,
we got up to resume our march. No one molested
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>us during the night; the morning broke cold and
foggy.</p>

<p>According to the “order of march” we should
have been at the head of the column, but some
regiment forestalled us, and we had to wait nearly
an hour before making a start.</p>

<p>At about midday we reached a pass in the hills,
well lined with trenches, and, after making a short
halt in the pass itself, we pushed on, marching at a
good pace.</p>

<p>At the instance of General Fock the mountain
road had been repaired at an earlier date, and now
did us sterling service, but, hard as we went, we did
not overtake our baggage, and the whole of that day
we had nothing but the bread procured at Nan-kuan-ling
from the 14th Regiment. We spent the night
in a picturesque defile, and perforce lay down to
sleep on empty stomachs.</p>

<p>On May 28 we overtook an enormous train of
baggage from Dalny,<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
accompanied by the male inhabitants
of the town, with their women, children, and
household goods. As the horses in the wagons were
wretchedly small, the train had to come to a standstill,
blocking the road from end to end.</p>

<p>We went round by a narrow side road, and in the
evening reached the great Shipinsin Pass,<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> where at
last we overtook our baggage.</p>

<p>Now in high spirits, we bivouacked, cooked our
suppers, ate them ravenously, and slept the sleep
of the just.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following day, May 29, we began to ascend
the pass, which, thanks to our excellent horses, our
baggage train speedily traversed, and although at
midnight we lost our way, owing to bad maps, we
eventually reached the outskirts of Port Arthur and
halted at the village of Pa-li-chuang, where we
had been ordered to rest for three days.</p>

<p>General Stessel visited the regiment the following
day. The companies quickly formed up near the
bivouacs, and the general rode round them all and
thanked them for their splendid behaviour. The
men felt tremendously encouraged, many of them
having laboured under the dire impression that we
had committed a crime by surrendering Nan Shan
to the enemy.</p>

<p>General Stessel called to the front all those wounded
who had remained in the ranks, in order to address
them, and to bestow praise and rewards in the shape
of the Cross of St. George. There were, however,
so many of them (more than 300) that the general
thought it was impossible to get so many crosses;
he therefore ordered the doctor to inspect them and
separate the badly from the slightly wounded. There
were sixty of the former category, and they were
given St. George’s crosses accordingly. These were
the sole recipients of rewards for the Nan Shan battle,
those slightly wounded receiving nothing for their
bravery—and the number of such was great.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the fact that our men
came away with only their rifles, most of the tents
and great-coats having been left on the field of battle.
It was fortunate that just before the battle we
had transported the bulk of our stores into Port<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Arthur, where they had been deposited in Captain
Preegorovski’s house, which had been hired for the
purpose. We brought all we wanted out of Port
Arthur without delay, and distributed the necessaries
among the men. At the same time we drove out
with us a large herd of cattle, amounting to about
200 head.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that our ordinary military
anxieties on the Nan Shan position had been
augmented by the worry due to an order to
collect all the cattle belonging to the inhabitants
and to drive them to the rear of the position. Some
officials, supplied with money, were sent out for this
purpose, but as they could not effect their object
without the assistance of the regiment, the whole
burden of the work fell upon us.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the order was given when the
enemy was already in touch with us, but we managed
to collect about 1,000 head and drove them to the
rear of the army, almost into Port Arthur.</p>

<p>After three days’ rest we moved into Port Arthur
and stopped in a village near Serotka Hill,<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> forming
the reserve of the 4th Division, which took up the
position Shuang-tai-kou, Yu-pi-la-tzu, Chien Shan,
and Lao-tso Shan.<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The 4th Division had been reinforced by a detachment
of mixed companies of the 7th Division, under
the command of Colonel Semenov, and it was this
detachment that occupied Lao-tso Shan. I do not
know exactly what they had done amiss, but I remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
it was commonly said that the mixed companies
were not to be depended upon, which is not to
be wondered at, seeing that they had no stiffening of
seasoned troops. The commanders of the companies
did not know their own men, nor had the men any knowledge
of their commanders. No one felt responsible for
the actions of the different units. This organization
was considered a huge mistake on General Kondratenko’s
part; but, however that may be, the position
in question was held by us from the time of its
occupation, on May 31, till July 28, in spite of the
fact that it had not previously been fortified.</p>

<p>During this time the 5th Regiment was divided
into two parts, and I was put in command of the
left flank of the defence, and began to fortify the
position on 174 Metre Hill and the country in front
of it, as also the western side of Feng-huang Shan<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
from the Great Mandarin road to Eight Ships’ Bay.
Stationed along the shore of the latter was Captain
Sakatski’s detachment, and two other detachments
were on the banks of Louisa Bay, both under my
command, the former having with it four small
naval guns under Midshipman Doudkin.</p>

<p>Our 6th and 7th Companies occupied and fortified
Feng-huang Shan from the Great Mandarin road up
to Major Sakatski’s detachment. Our three scout
detachments occupied and fortified the 174 Metre
and Headquarter Hills, and also Height 426.<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The
3rd and 9th Companies occupied 174 Metre Hill,
while the 2nd and 4th held 203 Metre Hill. They
all worked hard at their fortifications under the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>supervision of their officers, in accordance with
orders given by me.</p>

<p>174 Metre Hill had to be fortified as strongly as
possible, as, having once captured that, the enemy
could sweep our extremely weak western front,
occupy the valley stretching in the direction of the
New Town, and command the latter and the bay.</p>

<p>The other companies of the regiment were quartered
in various positions near. At times when the
advanced regiments behind Feng-huang Shan were
threatened, the 5th Regiment served as the reserve
for the different sections of the advanced line.</p>

<p>Our work advanced slowly, because we had very
few tools.</p>

<p>Besides fortifying the position, I had to build
shelters for the reserves and stores for small-arm
ammunition in the fortress itself.</p>

<p>I detailed two companies of the 7th Division for
this work, utilizing all the material we could find in
the town. Having no sapper officer with me, I
had personally to supervise everywhere—on the advanced
positions as well as in the town. It was a
great help that the officers of the 5th Regiment
were, thanks to constant practice, excellent sappers.</p>

<p>We could only obtain tools with great difficulty
and from various sources. Most of them we got from
Colonel Grigorenko, commanding the Engineers in
the fortress, and from the railway authorities.</p>

<p>The number of men given me to carry out the work
which I had been ordered to do was insufficient, so
I asked if I could employ the whole of my regiment.
I received permission early in June, and moved the
regimental staff to Division Hill, where we made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
ourselves very snug, pitching a huge marquee and
getting our field kitchen into working order.</p>

<p>Generals Kondratenko, Smirnov, and Stessel came
out to us fairly frequently. Our work progressed
rapidly, as we had got over the tool difficulty, but
we had very few barrows, etc., for transporting the
earth.</p>

<p>A stubborn defence having been determined upon,
it was necessary to construct a great number of
splinter-proofs as well as shelters for ourselves and
our kitchens; and for this we needed an abundant
supply of beams and planks.</p>

<p>Besides this activity we had constantly to send
detachments to the advanced positions held by the
regiments of the 4th Division.</p>

<p>Other regiments continually borrowed the tools I
had collected, but did not return them.</p>

<p>I frequently went on long personal reconnoitring
tours, during which I made myself acquainted with
the advanced positions and their fortifications.</p>

<p>It seems that General Fock expected that the
Japanese would most probably attack our position
across the flat stretch of country between the hills
and the sea. In any case, he paid most attention
to fortifying this particular part of the position. To
me, however, it was very clear how difficult it would
be to attack a fortified position across the open under
effective gun and rifle fire. Not even taking into
account the Japanese love of hill-fighting, it was
obvious that the hills were by far the best point of
attack, and these General Fock wished to have
defended only by the scout detachments.</p>

<p>Here the defenders were deprived of their strongest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
weapon, viz. distant, and even close, rifle and artillery
fire. As to the assailants, numerical superiority
and the power of initiative gave the Japanese tremendous
advantage in the hills, the more so, as our
position was very much extended, covering about
8 versts for five regiments of three battalions each
(about 10,000 men). The Japanese guns could, moreover,
demolish our trenches, whereas our artillery
could not find any targets.</p>

<p>When I inspected the position at the beginning of
July, I noticed that the position at Shuang-tai-kou
(between the hills and the sea) was splendidly fortified
(the trenches were deep, with a magnificent field of
fire), but the hills were left entirely without fortifications.</p>

<p>I rode down into Yu-pi-la-tzu, where there were
two scout detachments-of what regiment, I do not
remember. There were no trenches and, above all, no
cover from gun fire. This was a great mistake, as the
whole of the enemy’s artillery fire might be directed
on Yu-pi-la-tzu, and our men driven out of it, after
which the Japanese could occupy the hill without loss.</p>

<p>Having ascended the hill, a magnificent panorama
met the eye. The whole country as far as Dalny and
the bay beyond lay before one as the lines on the
palm of the hand, and in the daytime every single
movement of the enemy could be noted.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Yu-pi-la-tzu Hill was a very important point.
If we lost it, we should have to retreat to the Shipinsin
Pass.<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But the enemy did not hurry matters. Having
come within long-range rifle fire from the hills (as
was to have been expected, he paid no attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to the low-lying ground), he dug trenches and set
to work to lay his plans with deliberation.</p>

<p>From the moment of his first coming into touch
with us, at the beginning of May, till July 26, he
pressed our right flank, and compelled us to change
our position, and on the 26th commenced his
attack on the entire hill section.</p>

<p>The 5th Regiment was moved up to act in support.
Some time before this our 3rd Battalion had been
sent to the right flank to Lao-tso Shan, where we
lost two excellent officers, Captain Koudriavtsev and
Lieutenant Popov.</p>

<p>The 3rd Battalion had to bear the brunt of the
retreat from Lao-tso Shan, since, as had been expected,
the mixed companies on the right flank did
not distinguish themselves when it came to fighting.</p>

<p>On July 20 my 2nd Battalion was directed to go
to 11th Verst station<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> to the headquarters of the 4th
Division, and there it went accordingly, under the
command of Major Stempnevski (jun.).</p>

<p>When the enemy began his decisive attack on
the 26th, I was moved up with the 1st Battalion,
which was then commanded by Major Stempnevski
(sen.), a splendid all-round officer. I arrived with
my battalion in the morning and found all our commanders
with the divisional staff—Generals Stessel,
Fock, and Kondratenko. The battle was raging
along the whole line.</p>

<p>As all the positions were divided into sections,
and each section had its commander, I was free to
become a spectator of all that was going on. We
went by train to 11th Verst, and had only just got
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>down out of the carriages, when the 1st Scout Detachment,
under Lieutenant Kostoushko, was ordered
to move on Yu-pi-la-tzu Hill, where the defenders
had been decimated by the ceaseless artillery fire.</p>

<p>The 1st Battalion was then moved to the Shipinsin
Pass, where, judging by the artillery fire, a determined
attack was in preparation, and only our 7th
and 8th Companies were left with the regimental
staff.</p>

<p>General Fock directed the whole defence.</p>

<p>The fighting of July 26 and 27 did not cost us
very dearly, except for severe wounds received by
Lieutenant Kostoushko (a wound in the chest, and
a number of other wounds in the left shoulder and
side). This officer had thrown himself, with a part
of his scouts, on the enemy, who had already seized
some of our trenches on Yu-pi-la-tzu Hill. This was
on the night of July 27–28.</p>

<p>Towards evening on the 26th, General Stessel had
sent a telegram to the town saying that all the attacks
of the Japanese had been unsuccessful that day.</p>

<p>On the 27th the battle was again renewed along
the whole line. Lao-tso Shan was swept by the fire
of very heavy guns—probably 6-inch, judging from
the size of the shell bursts. It was very difficult
for our artillery to cope with these guns, as they were
not only very far off, but also well concealed.</p>

<p>Having nothing to do, I went to my 1st Battalion,
which was drawn up as a reserve on the declivity of
the Shipinsin Pass. Scarcely any shells burst near
us; they all went “over,” shattering the rocky
sides of a ravine lying behind.</p>

<p>Our battery on the pass itself was literally swept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with Japanese shell, and there was a continuous
roar of musketry fire, under which our men were,
however, perfectly calm, and even joked about the
bad shooting of the Japanese gunners. Though this
went on all day, the defence stood firm the whole
time.</p>

<div class="center-img-landscape" id="image_Page_73">

  </div>
</div>

<p>However, things went badly for us on Yu-pi-la-tzu
Hill. The Japanese crawled up its abnormally steep
sides on to the hill-top itself. All shelter had been
destroyed by artillery fire, and a corner of a casemate
had fallen in and crushed the officer commanding,
Lieutenant-Colonel Goosakov, whose loss every one
felt keenly. (It is opportune to mention here that
he was the only staff officer who helped me to organize
the defence of the rearward position which covered
our retreat from Nan Shan.) At this period of the
conflict the defenders concentrated behind stones
and ruined trenches, with the enemy only a few
paces from them.</p>

<p>The staff officers shouted out that Yu-pi-la-tzu
had to be abandoned, as its further defence would
only cause us enormous losses, because the trenches
no longer gave cover from the effects of Shimose
and shrapnel. Since, however, the majority were
against giving up this important hill, which was such
an excellent observation point, the commanders decided
to rebuild the trenches during the night and
continue the defence.</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the afternoon our 8th Company
was sent to Yu-pi-la-tzu Hill with as many tools
as could be found, to reconstruct the old, and make
new, trenches. Captain Sakarov, late commandant
of Dalny, who built the railway and port there, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
put in command. (After leaving Dalny, this excellent
officer decided to leave the Port Arthur Fortress
Sapper Company, which was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Jerebtsov.) The Japanese met with
practically no success on this day, and we held on
to all our positions.</p>

<p>Very early on the morning of the 28th, being
awakened by a terrific cannonade, I got up and went
to headquarters, where I found all the staff officers
already up. In order the better to watch the course
of the action, General Stessel, with some of his staff,
had gone to the top of the nearest hill, and thither I
repaired also. General Fock remained with the telephones,
keeping all his staff with him (he had new
adjutants; the old ones, Captain Kvitkin and,
subsequently, Captain Yarsevitch, had rejoined their
units).</p>

<p>On reaching the top of the hill, a magnificent
panorama of the hill country lay before us. The
crest nearest us, which was occupied by our troops,
was completely wreathed with puffs of white smoke.
In some places the smoke spread over an enormous
extent and curled high up into the air. It lay thickest
over Lao-tso Shan, for the heaviest types of shell were
constantly bursting there, and the sky was dotted
with little round white clouds from bursting shrapnel.
At the same time the attentive and well-trained ear
could distinguish the ceaseless far-distant roll of
rifle fire, due to the rattle of musketry along the line
occupied by us.</p>

<p>Our 1st Battalion had not yet come into action,
but was to be seen as a black spot near a zigzag in the
road leading to the Shipinsin Pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>We stayed about a quarter of an hour on the hill,
and then went down to the telephones (one can follow
an action better from near the telephones, even
though they are placed lower down, as in this case).
It is a pity that they did not think of putting them
in a place where it was possible to see the battle
with one’s own eyes as well as hear reports, as, for
example, on the top of the hill we had just left.</p>

<p>General Fock met us below, and at once gave
General Stessel full details of all that had taken place.
Our men had stood firm everywhere, except on
Yu-pi-la-tzu Hill, where things were going badly
with us. It was a physical impossibility to hold on
there, in spite of the new trenches, on account of the
artillery fire concentrated on the hill. Hence it was
decided to abandon Yu-pi-la-tzu, and orders were
sent there accordingly.</p>

<p>When this decision had been arrived at, General
Fock said, in his short, sharp way of speaking: “Well,
it is impossible to hold on to Yu-pi-la-tzu. It would
entail too heavy losses. Even if the companies
there left it of their own accord, it would be nothing
serious; but to give up Lao-tso Shan, that would be a
disgrace, almost amounting to treachery.” He had
only just said this, when news came that Lao-tso
Shan had been evacuated by the troops holding it.
“Now we shall have to make a general retreat,” said
General Fock, and he gave orders to retire and to
take up a new position with the right flank at Ta-ku
Shan—the centre near 11th Verst, and the left
on Feng-huang Shan.</p>

<p>In order to give the line cohesion, my left flank
(Captain Sakatski’s detachment) was put at the disposal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of the officer commanding the 15th Regiment.
I had to occupy without delay the spur of 174 Metre
Hill, as well as that hill itself and 203 Metre Hill, and
also Division Hill and the crest of Pan-lung Shan lying
in front of it. The 5th Regiment thus filled up the
gap between Forts Yi-tzu Shan and Ta-yang-kou
North, which had long ago been prepared by us. The
staff, with General Stessel at its head, collected in the
building occupied by the staff of the 4th Division (a
station at 11th Verst) and quietly waited there until
the regiments had taken up their allotted positions.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the statements of certain war-correspondents,
I saw no signs of any panic or
disorder during this retirement. Every one was
perfectly calm, and the army withdrew to its new
positions correctly and without any confusion.</p>

<p>Suddenly there appeared in the valley to our right
a Red-Cross train full of wounded, a sight which
always impresses one; there was a long stream of
wagons, accompanied by bearer-company men, doctors,
and those of the wounded who were able to
walk. Behind this train appeared a reserve column.
At that depressing moment I remembered how our
band had put new spirit into us during the night
alarm near the Nan-kuan-ling Hills, and felt a desire
to repeat the experiment.</p>

<p>So, having obtained permission from General Stessel,
I sent for the band, which was bivouacked near the
railway station, and soon the strains of a stirring
march crashed out over those hills, dark with death
and blood. The retreating army formed into columns,
and, picking up the step by the band, swung past
General Stessel. This march-past continued for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
nearly an hour under the very eyes of the enemy.
Our splendid 3rd Battalion was the last to go past,
bearing with it the body of Captain Kvitkin, General
Fock’s former A.D.C. The 5th Regiment had lost
altogether 2 officers and 60 men. They had borne
the whole brunt of the Japanese final attacks, and
had covered the retreat of the other regiments, presenting
an impregnable front throughout every attack.</p>

<p>It is obvious from the foregoing details that the
retreat from Lao-tso Shan was made in perfect order.</p>

<p>The following is a description of the action of our
companies on Lao-tso Shan:</p>

<p>The positions occupied<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> by the regiment were as
follows:</p>

<p>The detachment of Colonel Dounin, commanding
the 3rd Battalion 5th Regiment, consisting of the 5th,
6th, 9th, 11th, and 12th Companies, and the 2nd and
3rd Scout Detachments of the 5th Regiment and the
1st Company of the 27th, was posted before the
battle on Lao-tso Shan, and occupied the section from
the valley (near the small hill occupied by the 11th
Company of the 27th Regiment) to a spur 3/4 verst
from the village of Vodymin<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and touching the foot
of Chien Shan.</p>

<p class="no-margin-bottom">The various companies occupied the following
sections:</p>

<p class="lh1p4 no-margin-top no-margin-bottom">1. The 9th Company and 3rd Scout Detachment
5th Regiment, on the right flank in the valley.</p>

<p class="lh1p4 no-margin-top no-margin-bottom">2. Next to these the 2nd Scout Detachment, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
left of the valley and covering Lieutenant Naoomov’s
battery.</p>

<p class="lh1p4 no-margin-top no-margin-bottom">3. Farther to the left, the 12th Company 5th
Regiment.</p>

<p class="lh1p4 no-margin-top no-margin-bottom">4. On the extreme left flank, near Vodymin, the
11th Company 5th Regiment and, as a reserve, the
1st Company 27th Regiment.</p>

<p class="lh1p4 no-margin-top">5. The 5th and 6th Companies 5th Regiment
formed the general reserve.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th the Japanese opened
a heavy gun fire on our positions, followed by a vigorous
attack, but they obtained no hold anywhere that
day, as our men held on to their positions and beat
them back at every point.</p>

<p>On the 27th the Japanese repeated their attacks,
but had no more success than on the preceding day,
whereupon they proceeded to make a night attack.</p>

<p>Some companies to the right of Colonel Dounin
retreated without firing a shot, and so hurriedly,
that they failed to inform the companies on either
side of them.</p>

<p>The Japanese rushed into the gap thus created,
and, working round to the rear, began to pour a
flanking fire into the other companies, who were
ignorant of what had happened, and had remained
in their positions. Taken by surprise, these companies
lost their heads in turn and retreated, also
without informing their neighbours. In this manner
the gap grew rapidly until it extended to Colonel
Dounin’s troops, when the following became the
position of affairs:</p>

<p>The 9th Company and 3rd Scout Detachment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the 5th Regiment occupied the valley, being in touch
on the right with the 11th Company 27th Regiment.
The 3rd Scout Detachment formed the outpost line,
with the 9th in reserve behind it.</p>

<p>About three o’clock<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> on the morning of the 28th
the piquet on the right, which was keeping touch
with the 11th Company, reported that a retreat was
in progress on that side.</p>

<p>Captain Koudriavtsev, commanding the 9th Company,
sent an orderly to the hill occupied by the
11th Company to find out what was going on there.
The orderly returned immediately and reported that
the 11th Company had gone, that a small body of
Japanese was occupying the hill, and that reinforcements
were coming up to them. At first Captain
Koudriavtsev did not believe this, and wanted to
send a more reliable man, but just at that moment
shots rang out from the hill in the direction of the
9th Company and 3rd Scout Detachment, and Captain
Koudriavtsev’s doubts were dispelled. He consulted
with Lieutenant Choulkov, commanding the 3rd Scout
Detachment, and they came to the conclusion that it
would be unreasonable to try and hold the position
and defend the valley with the Japanese on the hill
above. They therefore determined to go up with
the 9th Company before daybreak, while there were
not many Japanese on the hill, retake it, and,
having got possession of it, re-establish communication
with the troops on the right, and thus fill
in the gap that had been left in the line. Arrived at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>this decision, Captain Koudriavtsev arranged with
Lieutenant Choulkov that they should support each
other, and if either had to retreat, he would immediately
inform the other, and, in order to avoid misunderstandings,
written messages only were to be
accepted. Captain Koudriavtsev then told Lieutenant
Choulkov to remain in his present position
with the 3rd Scout Detachment and await his
orders, while he himself, with half the 9th Company,
started to make the attack, the other half of the
9th Company being left meanwhile under Acting
Ensign Shishkin with orders to follow him as a
reserve.</p>

<p>In spite of the terrible fire with which the Japanese
met the attackers Captain Koudriavtsev with his half-company
reached the trenches, and with a wild
“hurrah” rushed in with the bayonet. The blow
fell partly on the Japanese flank. A hand-to-hand
fight ensued. Unfortunately, Captain Koudriavtsev
was killed, and Sergeant-Major Evlanov wounded as
he was mounting the hill; many of the men also
were placed <i>hors de combat</i>, and the remainder, not
feeling themselves strong enough to overpower the
enemy, began to retreat, carrying with them the body
of their dead captain. In the darkness our men did
not retreat back along the line of their advance, nor
towards the 3rd Scout Detachment and the reserve,
but in the direction in which the other companies had
retreated previously. The reserve half of the 9th
Company, not knowing what had happened, but
guessing from the direction of the firing and the
noise of moving men that the 1st half-company had
retired, and being met, moreover, by a heavy rifle fire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
themselves, began to retreat in the same direction.
Acting Ensign Shishkin, unfortunately, did not think
of telling Lieutenant Choulkov what had happened,
and the latter awaited word from Captain Koudriavtsev,
as had been arranged. In this way twenty
minutes or half an hour passed. Then, as day broke,
the Japanese fire from the hill became still heavier
and more vicious.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Choulkov learnt of the failure of the
9th Company from some of the rank and file who had
got left behind in the retreat, and who stumbled upon
the 3rd Scout Detachment in the darkness. Fully alive
to the danger of being surrounded, he ordered the
outposts to come in, and sent word of the position of
affairs to a company extended to his left. Fearing
for the fate of the machine guns, which were behind
him, Lieutenant Choulkov sent one section to them
as escort, but the guns were gone. As soon as the
outpost line had come in, Lieutenant Choulkov began
to retreat with his command in a compact body, and
soon joined up with the reserve, behind which
Colonel Dounin concentrated the retreating troops
and brought them into a state of order.</p>

<p>The reserve was in the valley, and, hearing of the
retreat of the companies to his right, Colonel Dounin
ordered what reserves he had to occupy a neighbouring
hill on the right, in order to hold up the enemy’s
advance while he formed a new defensive line from
the village of Vodymin across Riji Hill,<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> through
Lieutenant Naoomov’s battery of 57-mm. guns, and
farther on to some unnamed hills. Thanks to Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>Dounin’s dispositions, and to the courage of the
officers of the detachment, they succeeded in forming
the new defensive line at the point mentioned, and in
cooling the ardour of the Japanese in their fiery
advance.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards the order to retreat was
received from General Fock.</p>

<p>While Colonel Dounin was giving the necessary
orders, another order came in from General Fock to
retire on Height No. 86.<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Dounin retreated in splendid order, in
some cases personally conducting the skirmishing
line, and, covering one company with another, occupied
the positions ordered by General Fock—namely,
Height No. 86, next a position near the
village of Hou-chia-tun, then Saidjashalin,<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and
finally 11th Verst. Having covered the retreat of
parts of the 13th, 14th, and other regiments, the
companies themselves passed behind Feng-huang
Shan.</p>

<p>The whole of the force, and especially the officers,
acted in a manner worthy of the highest praise. In
holding back the victorious Japanese, all the companies
displayed remarkable bravery; for instance,
the 11th Company of the 5th Regiment with the 1st
Company of the 27th Regiment held Vodymin for two-and-a-half
hours, though surrounded on three sides.
Nevertheless, they broke their way through, taking
with them a machine gun that had been left on the
road and three wounded men of the 26th Regiment.
The 6th Company, which held back the Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>with rapid fire in order to allow its comrades to get
away, continued to hold its ground under a heavy
cross-fire from rifles and guns, and, amongst others,
lost its gallant commander, Lieutenant Popov, who
set an example of unparalleled bravery to the whole
of his company.</p>

<p>After the evacuation of Lao-tso Shan the army
took up the new positions assigned to it, and we
remained near the station (11th Verst—the headquarters
of the 4th Division) and prepared to cook
our breakfasts.</p>

<p>But suddenly a bullet whistled past, followed by
another, and this reminded us that no one was covering
our rear. The staff got into some confusion,
wagons were hastily horsed, and two companies (I
do not remember which regiment they belonged to)
were ordered to move in the direction of the enemy
and hold him back. These companies quickly occupied
a height close by, covering the staff from
the enemy, and the firing became general. The
whistling of bullets became more frequent, and the
horsing of the wagons of the staff was hurried on.
We saw that it was useless to try to breakfast in
such an unpleasant place, and the staff, with fifty
Cossacks and accompanied by General Stessel, began
to move into the fortress, stopping every now and
then to see what was going on in front. I rode off
to 174 Metre Hill, and on the way climbed a fairly
high eminence to see what was happening in rear.
I found our own battery there placed in some well-constructed
trenches, and the guns directing their
fire on the station at 11th Verst. Everything was
soon put in order, and nothing further happened to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
prevent our men occupying their new positions, on
which could already be seen the rising smoke of the
field kitchens.</p>

<p>Towards the evening of July 29 the 5th Regiment
had settled down in its new positions, had supper,
and turned in for the night, except the outposts,
whom I had sent out far in front in the direction
of the enemy. (I always did this, even when our
own troops were in front of us, as on this occasion.)
I placed my staff on Division Hill, and built an office,
and a mess-room for the officers.</p>

<p>The situation was a very picturesque one. In
front were the ridges of Division Hill, with two

<p class="hang small">Retreat from Feng-huang Shan, July 30—Fortifying 174 Metre Hill—Capture
of Kan-ta Shan—Attacks on the advanced hills, August
13, 14, and 15—Retreat to Namako Yama and Division Hills—Losses.</p>

<p class="noindent">Early on the morning of July 31, I learnt that our
men on Feng-huang Shan had hurriedly retreated
into the fortress without offering any serious
resistance to the enemy. This was extremely unwelcome
news, for now we should have to come
into direct touch with the enemy round the
fortress itself.</p>

<p>Major Saratski’s force had to occupy the crest
of Pan-lung Shan from Headquarter Hill to the redoubts
of the 26th Regiment near Fort Yi-tzu Shan.
As this detachment proved insufficient for the defence
of this section, I sent up our 11th and 12th Companies,
with some volunteers from our non-combatant company
under Sergeant-Major Bashchenko.<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> I posted
Midshipman Doudkin’s four small naval guns there,
and disposed the remainder of the regiment as follows:
on 203 Metre Hill the 2nd and 4th Companies, on
174 Metre Hill the 5th and 9th Companies, and on
Height 426 the 2nd Scout Detachment, with the
3rd Detachment in an advanced position; on Division
Hill the two Q.F. batteries of Colonels Petrov
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>and Romanovski (which had arrived from Kiev)
were posted with our 5th, 6th, and 7th Companies;
on Headquarter Hill the 1st Scout Detachment.
The remaining companies were in reserve.</p>

<p>Since, however, the line occupied exceeded 6
versts in length, we had all too few men for such a
wide extent of front.</p>

<p>I now return to our retreat from Feng-huang
Shan.</p>

<p>The hill and the position near 11th Verst, like that
on Ta-ku Shan, had been very weakly fortified by
us. I was well acquainted with the works on Feng-huang
Shan and those in continuation towards the
right flank, having gained this knowledge during,
and before, the fighting on the “Position of the
Passes.”</p>

<p>These fortifications consisted of deep trenches with
hardly any parapet, placed at the very foot of the hills
which lay behind them, in accordance with General
Fock’s system. Right close up to the trenches
grew high <i>kao-liang</i>,<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> which completely blocked
the field of view from the trenches, and, like the plan
of the trenches themselves, the positions selected
for them afforded an example of the blind application
of a principle<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in itself sound enough. The
man responsible for the defence of the right flank of
Feng-huang Shan unhappily failed to apply this
principle correctly.</p>

<p>In his anxiety to adhere to the principle of a flat
trajectory he entirely lost sight of the fact that
every small mound, if only two or three feet high,
presents an impenetrable barrier to a low-flying
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>bullet. He also quite forgot that the slope of the
hill of itself affords an obstacle difficult to surmount;
and he, moreover, ignored the difficulties of
an eventual retreat from the trenches up the side
of the hill, sometimes a very steep one, as was the
case at Feng-huang Shan.</p>

<p>So the trenches on the right flank of Feng-huang
Shan were placed at the foot of its northern
side. In front of them grew <i>kao-liang</i> to the
height of 5 feet. The regiments occupying this
position were disposed throughout the trenches in
question.</p>

<p>One of the officers of the 13th Regiment described
what happened thus:</p>

<p>“Having retreated from the Shipinsin Pass, the
regiment occupied part of the trenches on Feng-huang
Shan, and began to cut down the <i>kao-liang</i>,
but only had time to destroy a belt of about 50
yards of it in front of the trenches. They had supper
and spent the night comparatively quietly. Very
early in the morning there was a stir among the
<i>kao-liang</i>, and before the men had time to seize
their rifles, the Japanese were 20 paces from
the trenches. Our troops, spread out over a wide
front, were unable to withstand the rush of the
Japanese columns and retreated up the hill and
beyond. There were no trenches on the top of
the hill. Seeing the retreat of the troops in the
centre and the Japanese in possession of their
trenches, the other regiments also began to retire
on thus finding their flanks exposed. Thanks to
our artillery, the Japanese were prevented from
advancing any farther and stopped behind the hills<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
which they had occupied. Only Ta-ku Shan and
Hsiao-ku Shan<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> were left in our hands.”</p>

<p>Another officer of the 13th Regiment gave the
following description of the fight:</p>

<p>“After the battle round Lao-tso Shan our men had
to occupy another position, of which the left flank
was Feng-huang Shan. The 13th Regiment occupied
the section from the Great Mandarin road to
11th Verst on the railway. We had the 1st, 2nd,
3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Companies in the
first line, and the 9th, 11th, and 12th in the reserve,
the 10th Company forming the artillery escort.
The whole of the 14th Regiment was in reserve
behind the 13th. The position occupied by us was
fortified according to General Fock’s system, <i>i.e.</i>
the trenches were dug at the very foot of the hill,
so that they afforded but a very poor field of fire,
and the Japanese could take advantage of cover
behind every clump or mound on the ground in
front. Besides this, in front of the trenches was
<i>kao-liang</i> of such a height that the whole of the
foreground was completely hidden from our men
sitting in the trenches. We did all we could to
destroy this vile stuff, but we had no time to cut
it down for more than 50 paces from the trenches,
and in some places to even a less extent.</p>

<p>“Colonel Prince Machabeli, commanding the left,
considering that his reserve was too weak, decided
to strengthen it by one company, and despatched
accordingly the following order to the firing line:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
‘Send back one of the companies from the position
to the reserve.’<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Captain R—— received this order.
On either side of him was Major G——, commanding
the 2nd Company, and Lieutenant L——, commanding
the 3rd Company. Captain R—— decided that he
would join the reserve. Unfortunately, Lieutenant
L—— came to the same conclusion, so they both
went back to the reserve. It is not known what Major
G—— decided to do, but he also disappeared somewhere.</p>

<p>“The Japanese saw these companies going away,
and, springing up to the attack, hurled themselves
into the gap without firing a shot, the high <i>kao-liang</i>
allowing them to come right up to our trenches
unobserved. Having gained this unoccupied point,
they worked round to the flank, and even the rear,
of the other companies, and poured in a murderous
fire. The 4th Company hurriedly evacuated its
position, but the 1st and 5th held on for some time.
At last, the 1st Company having lost 101 men and
the 5th 105, they began to retire, and, following them,
all the other companies climbed up the hill under a
hail of bullets from the Japanese now occupying
our trenches. There were no trenches at the top of
the hill, so our men went on into the town. Colonel
Machabeli was held responsible, and was removed
from the command of the regiment in consequence.”</p>

<p>This gallant field officer was afterwards killed on
the West Pan-lung Redoubt under the following
circumstances. The Japanese attacked the redoubt
and took the front glacis. Our men were lodged
in the rear. Colonel Machabeli stopped those who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>were retreating and, having inspired them with a
fiery speech, rushed forward, calling on his men to
follow him. Another moment and the Japanese
were driven out of the redoubt.</p>

<p>After this exploit Colonel Machabeli went back
to the rear face of the redoubt, and had only just
sat down to get his breath, when one of the men ran
up and reported that the Japanese had again captured
the front glacis. Once again Colonel Machabeli
collected his men round him and threw himself
on the Japanese, but just as he was jumping across
the inner ditch a bullet struck him. Our men hesitated,
wavered, and then evacuated the whole redoubt,
which remained from that time, together
with the body of the gallant colonel, in the hands of
the Japanese.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>After the capture of Feng-huang Shan the Japanese
took a rest, being contented with reconnaissance
work only; while, in the meantime, we strengthened
our positions, built kitchens, and made communication
trenches between the fortifications.</p>

<p>The companies bivouacked in places screened from
the enemy’s view. Luckily we had a good deal of
rain, which gave us water in abundance. The
soldiers dug out ponds near their bivouacs, and not
only washed their clothes, but even indulged in the
luxury of bathing.</p>

<p>Our scout detachments fared worst of all in this
respect, for they were far out in front, and had no
water.</p>

<p>We were much delayed in our work by the rocky
nature of the soil and the want of tools, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
picks, good axes, and shovels, of which implements
we needed a very large number. There was a sufficient
quantity of wood in the town, but we required
an enormous amount of it on the position itself.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>We had to make provision for dug-outs at the
rate of 50 per cent. for each company for the winter,
besides kitchens and baths for the battalions, and
shelters for the officers. Supplies of wood were
brought up on our baggage animals to all points on
the position, but there was scarcely a sufficiency
for all the needs of the companies. We worked
day and night for a long time, dividing our men
into three reliefs; nevertheless, our trenches were
far from being completed.</p>

<p>Besides the enormous amount of spade work we
had to do, we were handicapped by having to furnish
a very strong outpost line.</p>

<p>We had no fortifications on 174 Metre Hill capable
of resisting a direct attack, and a night attack might
always be crowned with success, so that our men
did not get much sleep. I very much feared night
attacks, and so determined to strengthen our trenches
by building redoubts. We had, however, as already
stated, but few tools and little time, and there was
so much work to be done, that it was absolutely
impossible to prepare for every contingency.</p>

<p>The enemy was at close quarters and could attack
at any moment. We had thus to watch his every
movement, the more so, as we had no definite line
of obstacles barring the way to the fortress, and even
a slight advantage gained at night might give the
enemy an open road into the New Town and, perhaps,
even farther. For this reason I felt extremely uneasy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout the siege a third of the regiment was
always on the alert.</p>

<p>This would not have been necessary if we had had a
better line of defences and obstacles, or at least twice
as many forts as we actually did have. There would
have been no moral and physical wastage, and scurvy
would not have hampered the defence of Port Arthur.</p>

<p>Although our own primary object was the fortification
of 174 Metre Hill, we could not do very much
work on the positions during our stay in Port Arthur,
being constantly sent to the reserves stationed at
Ying-cheng-tzu,<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> or to the right flank, or to the
centre near the pass.</p>

<p>We began to work seriously at the fortifications
only from the moment of the general retreat into
Port Arthur, but even then we were sadly handicapped
by the want of tools. It was lucky that the
enemy did not worry us much, but turned his
attention mainly to the right and centre.</p>

<p>The first shell fell into the town on Sunday,
August 7.</p>

<p>On the 8th, the Japanese captured Ta-ku Shan
and Hsiao-ku Shan. A number of the assaults
were beaten back by the troops holding the hills,
who fought day and night several days running.
But there is a limit to human strength. On the third
night the Japanese captured the hills, finding most
of the defenders asleep. I was told this afterwards
by men who had taken part in the defence.<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>After the capture of Ta-ku Shan we noticed (from
the observing stations we had organized) signs of a
Japanese concentration near Louisa Bay. With a
view to obtaining better observations, I was ordered
to occupy Kan-ta Shan with a section under an
officer. A ring trench had been made on this hill
(I do not know who constructed it), but <i>kao-liang</i>
surrounded the hill, and its defence was therefore a
very difficult matter, as it was possible to get close
up to the top under cover of the millet. Besides
this, Kan-ta Shan was nearer to the enemy than to
us, and was, moreover, in front of Colonel Semenov’s
section, and not mine. Steeling my heart, however,
I sent a section there under Acting Ensign Shishkin.
This section could easily be cut off and destroyed,
for which reason I posted at night a strong piquet
behind Kan-ta Shan for its support. From the
moment we occupied this hill we had nightly skirmishes
with the Japanese.</p>

<p>The enemy began to press us on all sides until,
on August 10, they captured Kan-ta Shan by a night
attack, but abandoned it in the day, when we again
took possession—only for a day, however, for the
Japanese recaptured the hill on the following
night, and this time fortified themselves strongly
on it.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>However much we longed to see our fleet cruising
on the flanks of the enemy’s line of investment, our
desire remained unsatisfied, for the ships did not
dare to leave the harbour,<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the enemy’s fleet being
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>vastly superior, both in the number of ships, and in
their quality.</p>

<p>We now had the pleasure of seeing five large
Japanese battleships appearing every day on the
horizon before Port Arthur.</p>

<p>On August 11, 12, and 13 we saw considerable
signs of movement on the enemy’s part in the direction
of our left flank. Trains of baggage and bodies
of troops were on the move. They carried out their
manœuvre very cleverly, making full use of all the
cover afforded by the unevenness of the ground.
However, they showed themselves occasionally to
our observers posted on the hills, and at night our
sentries, who were posted far out in front, could
plainly detect the sounds of moving wagons and
marching men.</p>

<p>It was evident that the enemy was preparing to
attack 174 Metre Hill. In view of this contingency
we were reinforced by two companies of young
sailors under the command of two of our officers,
Lieutenants Afanaisev and Siedelnitski.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the enemy from breaking
through between Height 426 and Headquarter Hill,
I ordered the sailors to make a trench connecting
Height 426 with the fortifications on Headquarter
Hill.</p>

<p>Two companies of the 14th Reserve Battalion
were sent up to strengthen our reserve. I placed
Major Ivanov in command of the firing line. The
reserve was posted near the bivouacs of the regimental
staff of the 5th Regiment, behind Division
Hill.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that Peredovaya (Advanced)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Hill<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> was very far in front, and held only as an observation
post by the 3rd Scout Detachment, this
detachment had orders, in case of a very determined
attack, or a turning of its flanks, to retire to Headquarter
Hill, where a position had been prepared
for it.</p>

<p>I was very much afraid that the Japanese would
take advantage of their superiority in numbers,
make a night attack, and capture our weak trenches,
the more so, as we had prepared practically no obstacles,
not having had time to do so. We had only
succeeded in putting up wire entanglements across
the front of the trenches on Height 426 and Headquarter
Hill.</p>

<p>We had been supplied with some star-rockets
for use at night, and batteries for these had been
stationed on Division, 203 Metre, and 174 Metre
Hills.</p>

<p>Events turned out as I had expected. On the
night of August 13–14 (I do not remember at what
time exactly) a mounted orderly reported that
large bodies of the enemy were moving up the road
to Headquarter Hill, and a few minutes afterwards
I heard heavy firing near Advanced Hill.</p>

<p>I got up and went with my orderlies to Division
Hill, to the reserve, finding every one at his post.</p>

<p>A report was now brought in that all our scout
detachments had been driven back on to 174 Metre
Hill and had occupied a line extending from that
hill in the direction of Pigeon Bay.</p>

<p>A terrific fire broke out and spread along the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>whole front. Our star-rockets hissed, speeding high
into the air, and their brilliant light showed the whole
ground in front.</p>

<p>Another orderly galloped up with a report from
the commander of the 1st Scout Detachment to the
effect that the 3rd Scout Detachment had evacuated
Advanced Hill and joined him, and that in conjunction,
thanks to the star-rockets, they had beaten
back the Japanese, who had fallen foul of the wire
entanglement on the right flank of Headquarter Hill.
The enemy’s losses had been very heavy.</p>

<p>I at once sent a report of what had occurred to
Colonel Irman,<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> but he himself came up to Division
Hill shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Rain began to fall and soaked us to the skin. At
daybreak the firing somewhat slackened, but shortly
afterwards the enemy’s artillery re-opened, causing
heavy losses to our companies.</p>

<p>Rifle and gun fire continued all day from both sides.
The enemy swept 174 Metre and Division Hills with
his guns, while our own artillery in turn swept the
plains below, as the enemy offered no good target
anywhere.</p>

<p>Having suffered considerably from our rifle fire,
the enemy lay low and did not attempt to make a
general assault. A Japanese column had worked
round our left flank and essayed to attack Height 426,
but the hostile troops were held up by the wire
entanglements and were entirely annihilated by our
2nd Scout Detachment, which had been strengthened
by two sections of the 3rd Company from 174 Metre
Hill.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>We suffered severely from the enemy’s artillery
fire.</p>

<p>Thus passed the whole of that day (August 14).
The two batteries of Colonel Petrov and Colonel
Romanovski, posted on Division Hill, sought in vain
for targets, but the enemy kept under cover with
remarkable skill.</p>

<p>There were constant alarms during the following
night, and firing continued without ceasing. The
enemy again attacked our trenches, but retreated
after losing heavily. In order to be ready to beat
back a night attack, we had moved the reserve nearer
to the firing line. Knowing every inch of the ground,
at about 10 p.m. I started off with Colonel Irman
and two companies towards Headquarter Hill. There
was fairly heavy firing in front of us.</p>

<p>We went on full of assurance, but in the darkness
we lost the road. We took our bearings by the features
of well-known hills, yet these same hills seemed now
to be quite different from those we knew so well by
day, and the sound of shots rang out from all sides
more loudly the farther we advanced.</p>

<p>Now we must have reached Headquarter Hill—but
no! it was not there. The firing was soon heard, not
only in front and from the flanks, but also far in rear.
We found ourselves in a very unpleasant position.
“Do you think we have gone beyond our firing line?”
I said to Colonel Irman. He answered that he had
not the faintest idea where he was. Then I proposed
that we should halt and send out scouts.</p>

<p>What if we were taken for Japanese by our own
people and met by a volley! That would be awkward
indeed. So we halted and had a good look round,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
but the place was absolutely unfamiliar. Still, firing
was going on all around. It was the most stupid
position I have ever been in. “Let us turn back,
Vladimir Nicholaievitch,” I said to Colonel Irman;
“we shall certainly reach some place that we can
recognize, and then we shall be all right.”</p>

<p>Colonel Irman agreed, and we turned “right-about.”
Some time passed, and at last we made out
the silhouette of Namako Yama, and once more
breathed freely.</p>

<p>We decided to leave the reserve behind the slopes
of 174 Metre Hill, where the men lay down under
arms on a ploughed field. Major Ivanov came up to
us, and we gave the reserve into his charge, we ourselves
starting off for Division Hill to try to get a
little sleep.</p>

<p>It had only just begun to grow light, when I was
inundated with reports from the hills attacked, the
Japanese having continued their various attacks all
night. They had come up to the wire entanglements,
but, failing everywhere to get through, they slipped
away again in the darkness. Our star-rockets did
sterling service throughout.</p>

<p>The dawn had not fully broken before the enemy’s
artillery thundered forth. I came out of the dug-out
of the commander of the 6th Company, and began to
observe over the top of the breastwork. Our three
hills were wreathed in smoke from the enemy’s high-explosive
and shrapnel shells, and looked like veritable
volcanoes in eruption. Though our men had sufficient
cover from shrapnel, the high-explosive shells, filled
with Shimose, caused fearful havoc.</p>

<p>A stream of wounded, on foot and in stretchers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
was moving along the road from the hills. It was
evident that the enemy was determined to drive us
off Advanced Hill, and our position was a serious one.
I consequently sent a report to that effect.</p>

<p>A message came in from Headquarter Hill asking
for reinforcements, and, pending the arrival of the
reserves, I sent one section of the 6th Company
out of the trenches. General Kondratenko saw
that here was no child’s play, and sent us two additional
companies—the 2nd (Rotaiski’s) and the 3rd
(Levitski’s) of the 13th Regiment.</p>

<p>It was a difficult thing to hold on to Advanced Hill,
as it had been the last to be fortified. The depth
of the trenches was normal, but their finish left much
to be desired. We had made shrapnel-proof head-cover,
but had had no time to trace traverses or
make cover for the reserves, so that our men suffered
severely from the enemy’s shell fire, which was very
heavy.</p>

<p>Before seven o’clock on the morning of August 15
all three hills had sent in requests for reinforcements,
in compliance with which I immediately sent forward
the two companies of the 13th Regiment, as I saw
companies of other regiments coming to our assistance.
General Kondratenko arrived on the scene at
about 8 a.m. Having explained how matters stood,
I drew his attention to the dangerous position of our
present observation post. Bullets were whistling
around us from all directions.</p>

<p>At this time Colonel Petrov’s and Colonel Romanovski’s
batteries, stationed on Division Hill, prepared to
open fire, although they had little hope of success,
as the enemy’s batteries were not visible and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
infantry was attacking from points which were only
within reach of the batteries far away behind Fort
Yi-tzu Shan. The consequence was that our men
had to fight the Japanese infantry under a murderous
artillery fire without the support of their own guns.</p>

<p>The situation was an impossible one, as it had been
at Nan Shan.</p>

<p>About 11 a.m. Colonel Irman rode up. Reinforcements
arrived also. The enemy’s gun fire was so
terrific at this time, that I wondered how our men
could continue to make any defence. But they were
putting up a gallant fight, for we could see how they
dashed out of their trenches, now to the right, now
to the left, how the reserves posted in rear of the
hills reinforced the men in the trenches, and how they
again charged out of the trenches and then retired
behind their scanty cover. The majority of our
officers were wounded and officers of other units took
command, but, judging from the enormous losses of
the 5th Regiment, one could not help feeling that
there were but few left in the trenches at all.</p>

<p>Major Ivanov had used all his reserves, and sent in
asking for more. Reports were received from every
quarter stating that the trenches had been absolutely
wrecked by the enemy’s shells, and that it was impossible
to hold on under such artillery fire. The
fire was indeed terrific, and General Kondratenko
felt inclined to order a retreat; but I sent up two
more companies to the left flank, one of them (a
company of the Reserve Battalion) to the reserve
behind the left flank, as the enemy was devoting his
main energy towards that side. And now, at midday,
it seemed as if the Japanese had concentrated the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
whole of their artillery, not only to utterly destroy the
defenders, but to level the very hills themselves.</p>

<p>Our guns were still inactive, being unable to
locate the positions of the enemy’s batteries. As
I have mentioned before, however, two batteries
standing near us were preparing to open fire. This
drew the enemy’s attention, and he began to pour
a stream of shell upon us as well as bullets. One of
them burst close to Major Schiller, and killed him
outright, and also wounded Colonel Petrov, the
battery commander. The former was struck by a
large splinter in the left breast and the latter in the
left eye (he died the following day in hospital).</p>

<p>A little before this we saw unmistakable signs of a
speedy retirement.</p>

<p>In order not to be taken at a disadvantage, I had
arranged for a second line of defence (174 Metre Hill,
Namako Yama, and Division Hill). When I had done
this, and inspected our trenches with Captain Sichev,
commanding the 6th Company, I noticed that the
enemy’s rifle fire was especially directed on our
trenches on Division Hill. We had not long to wait
for confirmation of this fact (if it were needed), for
Captain Sichev was wounded in the leg—luckily, not
seriously, as the bullet did not touch the bone.</p>

<p>Having completed my round, I returned to General
Kondratenko, and saw that our men were streaming
away from Headquarter Hill, like powder spilling out of
a barrel, and shortly afterwards from Height 426 also.
An exclamation of annoyance escaped the general.
“See! surely it is easier for them there than it is
on Height 426. What are they running for? They
<i>must</i> be stopped!” Colonel Irman, who was standing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
near, took the general’s words as an order and hurried
off to carry it out, taking Captain Iolshin of the
general staff with him.<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>“And you, Nicholai Alexandrovitch,” said General
Kondratenko, turning to me, “take a company, and
attack their left flank when they come down the hill
in pursuit.” There was a company waiting not far
behind us, and I should very soon have carried out
the order given me, but I had scarcely gone half a
verst with the company, when a mounted orderly
galloped up and gave me an order to return immediately
to General Kondratenko and hand over the command
to Lieutenant-Colonel Naoomenko, who was
close to me at the time. When I again reached
Division Hill, I saw our army in full retreat from the
three advanced hills. On the crest of the hills that
had been occupied by us (Height 426, Headquarter Hill,
and Advanced Hill) appeared lines of the enemy’s
skirmishers. Our men retreated without haste, returning
the enemy’s fire, but strewing the ground
they were passing over with bodies. Three mounted
men were seen galloping along the retreating line;
they were Colonel Irman, Captain Iolshin, and Colonel
Zoobov, the latter commanding the 4th Reserve
Battalion. But their efforts were in vain and the
retreat continued without check.</p>

<p>When Colonel Irman returned, he reported that
he had been unable to stop the retreating line, and the
only men who paid any attention to him were a few
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>scouts of the 5th Regiment and the 1st Company
of the reserve battalion under Lieutenant Sadykov,
whom he recommended for a St. George’s Cross.</p>

<p>I consider it my duty to state here that Major
Ivanov acted in the most heroic manner during the
battle. When the 6th Company refused to go up
Headquarter Hill to the help of their comrades, Major
Ivanov said to the men: “If you don’t come with me
I shall lie down here to be shot”; and, running out
on to an open space that was swept by bullets, he lay
down on the ground. Then the commander of the
company rushed up with his men, lifted him up,
and said that the company would follow him wherever
he liked to lead them. However, on reaching the
hill, they found that it had been evacuated and
was now strongly held by the Japanese. Major
Ivanov then took the company back to Division
Hill.</p>

<p>General Kondratenko ordered me to stop the retreat
and to form a reserve for our subsequent defensive
line, and I set out to do my best. When the
Japanese appeared on Height 426 and Headquarter
Hill, our artillery swept these heights with shrapnel,
and cleared the summits of yellow-peaked caps in a
moment.</p>

<p>This was timely relief, as the Japanese began to
bring a flanking fire to bear from the trenches on
Headquarter Hill on the lines at Pan-lung Shan,
and our 11th Company suffered severely from this
fire. Things were already going badly at Pan-lung
Shan, and it was of vital importance to know what
was to be done next. To decide this, General Kondratenko
summoned all the commanders to come to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Division Hill. I also went there the moment I had
formed my reserves and posted them in a safe place.</p>

<p>Colonel Irman, Colonel Zoobov, and others were
already there. The noise of battle had become less,
and for the moment the Japanese showed no signs
of advancing any farther.</p>

<p>Our artillery ceased firing, as its targets had
disappeared over the top of the hills and taken cover
in the <i>kao-liang</i>. This was about 2 p.m.</p>

<p>Before undertaking anything further it was decided
to make an inspection of the positions behind
us on Pan-lung Shan, which General Kondratenko
ordered Colonel Naoomenko and myself to do. We
immediately went to Pan-lung Shan, from which our
11th Company, under Second-Lieutenant Lobyrev, had
already retreated. I asked: “Who ordered you to
retreat?” and he answered: “Major Katishev [commanding
the 11th Company; he had been wounded
in the arm and had been taken to the field hospital].
He told us to retreat, as it was impossible to remain in
the trenches, for Headquarter Hill was in the hands of
the Japanese.” On hearing this, I said: “You are
never to retreat without orders from a senior commander.
Go back again!”</p>

<p>Second-Lieutenant Lobyrev, a quiet, brave fellow,
answered: “It is all the same to us—we will go
back”; then, turning quickly to his men, he shouted
out: “Company, about turn, to the old position—march!”
and the company turned round and reoccupied
its trenches.</p>

<p>Having made an inspection of these trenches, we
came to the conclusion that it was, indeed, impossible
to remain in them, as their left flank rested on Headquarter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Hill and there was hardly any cover from fire
from that side.</p>

<p>We informed General Kondratenko of the result
of our inspection, and he decided to evacuate Pan-lung
Shan entirely as far as the redoubts on the right
flank of Division Hill. This was done at about 7 p.m.</p>

<p>Between Pan-lung Shan and Division Hill there
was a position favourable for defence, and I had
already had some work done on it and commenced
the construction of a large lunette. We should have
occupied this position with the companies which
retreated from Pan-lung Shan, but as we had no
tools for completing the works we had to abandon
the idea of holding it, and all the companies were
taken from Pan-lung Shan and placed in reserve
behind Division Hill and Namako Yama. The three
scout detachments were posted between 203 Metre
Hill and Fort Ta-yang-kou North, where they could
get some rest.</p>

<p>I will now give a detailed account of the fighting
on each of the hills attacked.</p>

<p class="noindent center p2"><span class="smcap bold">On Triok-Golovy Hill</span>
<span class="bold">(</span><span class="smcap bold">Three-Headed Hill</span><span class="bold">)</span>
<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>About 10 p.m. on August 13 the outposts were
driven back by the enemy on to their supports. The
1st Scout Detachment was surrounded, but fought
its way through at the point of the bayonet, bringing
along two badly wounded men and two Japanese
rifles.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock the Japanese attacked Advanced
Hill, which was held by one section (the 3rd) of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>3rd Infantry Scout Detachment, consisting of 36 men.
Favoured by darkness, the enemy completely surrounded
the hill on all sides. The non-commissioned
officer in charge, Nazarov, seeing that there was no
escape, attacked the enemy, and at this moment a
star-rocket burst, and by its light the men on Headquarter
Hill saw the Japanese, and at once poured a
hail of bullets into them, thus enabling Nazarov to
fight his way back to Headquarter Hill.</p>

<p>Having taken Advanced Hill, the Japanese climbed
up Headquarter Hill, but were beaten back with
heavy losses. Half an hour later they raised the cry
of “Banzai!” and again stormed our trenches from
the right flank, but in doing so they fell foul of the
wire entanglements and were nearly all wiped out.</p>

<p>About 2 a.m. the enemy repeated the attack in great
force; but only a few reached the trenches, where
they were bayoneted by our men. In this attack the
darkness greatly assisted the enemy, as the supply of
rockets being exhausted, no more could be sent up.</p>

<p>Towards morning on August 14, covered by fog
and rain, the enemy tried to overwhelm our scouts,
but without success. In this attack Acting Ensign
Zakrejevski was wounded, the sergeant-major of the
1st Detachment killed, and several scouts wounded.</p>

<p>I must mention a very fine piece of work on the
part of Corporal Vagin of the 3rd Scout Detachment.
Entirely on his own initiative, he occupied with his
section a hill that had been left unfortified, and by enfilade
fire afforded great relief from pressure on Headquarter
Hill and Height 426, whilst at the same time
beating back the Japanese attacking his own party.</p>

<p>All the non-commissioned officers acted like true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
heroes, and one of them, Lance-Corporal Khaidoulin
(a Tartar) of the 1st Scout Detachment, seeing that
the men of his section had expended all their ammunition
during the third attack, jumped up out of the
trench and shouted out, “Let us die, lads, for the
Czar and our Faith!” and prepared for a bayonet
charge. Just at that moment ammunition was brought
up, and the Japanese were driven off by rifle fire.</p>

<p>In the morning it was seen that the Japanese
had captured Advanced Hill, Kan-ta Shan, and a
small hill in front of the 12th Company at Pan-lung
Shan, from which they opened rifle fire, but the Baranovski
guns on Height 426 drove them under cover.</p>

<p>On account of sickness (dysentery) Lieutenant
Choulkov had been sent to hospital, and Acting
Ensign Elechevski was sent to take his place.</p>

<p>On the night of August 14 the supply of ammunition
began to run short and firing was stopped.
Thinking that we had abandoned the trenches, the
enemy tried to capture them. He was met at the
very edge of the trenches by some volleys which
almost annihilated him, only one officer and five
men, who had hidden behind some stones, being left.
At daybreak Sergeant Zmoushko, noticing that the
men behind the stones were not dead, began to watch,
and as soon as the officer showed his head, he shot
him. Seeing their officer killed, the soldiers ran
back, but were all shot down.</p>

<p>The ground in front of the trenches was strewn
with the bodies of the Japanese. In the morning
(August 15) the men of the 1st Scout Detachment
left the trenches in order to clean their rifles, which
had become choked from continual firing, and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
place was being taken by a company of the 4th
Reserve Battalion; at this moment, however, the
trenches were swept by such a terrible fire that the new
arrivals gave way and began to retreat. The men of
the Scout Detachment rushed up towards the trenches,
but, being unable to stem the retreat, they themselves
retired behind the slopes of the hills lying in
rear, and thence (when Headquarter Hill had been
occupied by the Japanese) to Division Hill.</p>

<p>Colonel Irman galloped up to the retreating men
and compelled them to turn back; but the Japanese
opened such a deadly fire from the machine guns
and rifles, that again they turned their backs.
At this time our field artillery swept the captured
hills with shrapnel, upon which the Japanese took
cover, and ceased firing on the retreating columns.</p>

<p>I consider it my duty here to mention the names
of two of our heroes. When our men were stopped
by Colonel Irman, they suffered such heavy losses
that they again began to retreat, except two men of
the 5th Regiment, Corporal Trusov and Private
Molchanov, who got right into the Japanese trenches;
but finding that they were only two, while the enemy
filled the trench, they beat a retreat—not, however,
before Molchanov had killed a Japanese officer.
They were both wounded slightly on their way back,
but nevertheless remained in the ranks.</p>

<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>At 10 p.m. on August 13, the sentries on Height 426
reported that four columns, each two companies
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
strong, were advancing on the hill. Second-Lieutenant
Andreiev immediately sent some sentries
out to the wire entanglement to give him warning
when the enemy had descended the opposite slope
and reached the wires.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock the sentries reported that the
Japanese were close at hand. Volley firing was immediately
opened, and Midshipman Doudkin’s small
guns also commenced firing, upon which the Japanese,
after suffering considerable losses, retreated behind
the hill.</p>

<p>At midnight they again attacked the hill, but were
again repulsed, and up to 5 a.m. they attacked seven
times without any success whatever.</p>

<p>They left piles of bodies in front of and amongst
the wire entanglements.</p>

<p>During the third attack it was seen that a column
of two companies had got through the wire on the
right flank. A section of the 2nd Scout Detachment
was immediately sent against them under the command
of Lance-Corporal Noskov, and this section,
together with the Baranovski guns, posted on that
flank, and two sections of the 9th Company sent
from 174 Metre Hill, put them to flight.</p>

<p>When day broke, 432 Japanese bodies were counted
round the wire entanglements.</p>

<p>By 7 a.m. half the trenches had been destroyed
by the enemy’s artillery, so that one section had to
be withdrawn and posted on the opposite slope of
the hill.</p>

<p>At 9.30 a.m. the Japanese broke through the wire
entanglements and got half-way up the hill, but
they were met by fire from the trenches—from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
left flank by volleys from the section of the 2nd
Infantry Scout Detachment, and from the right
by volleys from the sailors under the command of
Lieutenant Afanaisev; and, not being able to make any
headway, they retired. At 11 a.m. Second-Lieutenant
Andreiev was wounded, and the command devolved
on Lance-Corporal Kobrintsev. Captain Rotaiski
was sent to reinforce, but he did not occupy the
trenches, remaining instead behind their left flank.</p>

<p>During the day the enemy began to increase his
efforts against Height 426, and in consequence the
reserve was sent for, but did not arrive, though two
companies of the 4th Reserve Battalion were supposed
to have been sent up.</p>

<p>About midday, when the 1st and 2nd sections of
the 1st Detachment were annihilated by artillery fire,
a half-company of the reserve battalion, under a
second-lieutenant of the 27th Regiment, arrived and
occupied the right trench, and in the night another
half-company, with a sergeant-major, was sent up
with orders to occupy the saddle between Headquarter
Hill and a small hill to the left of it. Firing
went on the whole day, and on the night of August
14–15 the enemy made two attacks, but only succeeded
in one case in getting up to the wire entanglement,
where more than two-thirds of the attacking
party were lost.</p>

<p>The hill was captured at midday on August 15.
We retreated from the advanced positions, but were
in consequence considerably stronger on Division
Hill, Namako Yama, and 174 Metre Hill, on account
of the reserves concentrated there.</p>

<p>In view of the anticipated attack on these hills,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
we had to work hard on them, the more so, as Namako
Yama was very weakly fortified. The trenches were
small and unfinished, and the ground solid rock.</p>

<p>If only these trenches had been prepared beforehand,
it would have been quite a different matter.
How many lives would have been saved, and how
many attacks beaten back! It is always necessary
in a fortress to prepare defensive positions in peace
time, and this can be done conveniently as part of
the training of the troops in garrison.</p>

<p>The fighting on Headquarter Hill cost us somewhat
dearly. The Scout Detachments of the 5th Regiment
lost more than half their strength—160 men and
one officer (Second-Lieutenant Andreiev); the two
naval companies suffered a loss of 30 men each; the
remainder, represented by companies of the 13th
Regiment and of the 4th Reserve Battalion, were
reduced by quite 15 per cent. of their strength.
The 11th and 12th Companies at Pan-lung Shan
did not have many losses, but three officers were
placed <i>hors de combat</i>—Major Katishev being
wounded, and Second-Lieutenant Merkoulev and
Ensign Moukin killed.</p>

<p class="hang small">The fighting round 174 Metre Hill—Capture of 174 Metre Hill and
evacuation of Connecting Ridge—Fortifying 203 Metre Hill—Defence
and capture of Extinct Volcano.</p>

<p class="noindent">We had to work absolutely under the enemy’s very
nose, mostly at night, although we took the opportunity
of working in the daytime whenever the
enemy’s fire slackened a little.</p>

<p>It was a good thing that the 5th Regiment had
learnt something about trench-making, so that
the officers, and even the non-commissioned officers,
knew exactly how to go to work without any instruction
from sapper specialists, of whom we did
not possess a single man.</p>

<p>General Kondratenko did not propose recapturing
the advanced hills, as they were not exceptionally
important positions, and it would have cost us
dearly to hold on to them.</p>

<p>After August 15, things were fairly quiet on our
side, but bullets, and even shell, rather frequently
passed over the quarters of the regimental staff.
We had, therefore, to move them farther back, to
a small river running along the road from the town
towards 203 Metre Hill, and as a large mess tent
would have been visible from a great distance, we
decided not to pitch one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The Japanese had not got off lightly in their
attacks on the advanced hills, and their losses must
have been reckoned in thousands. They lost particularly
heavily in storming Height 426, where they
stumbled blindly upon the wire entanglements and
made repeated attacks. There were piles of dead
heaped up round these entanglements. The fact
must be noted that we were driven out of these
positions by gun fire, and not by the Japanese
infantry.</p>

<p>Events here made it clear to every one what preponderance
in artillery really means. The side that
silences the enemy’s guns can capture his positions
without particularly hard fighting, for, having once
got the enemy’s fire under control, one can choose a
point of attack, concentrate the whole of one’s artillery
on it, and then take it by storm with comparatively
small numbers. For this, however, a numerous,
well-trained, and efficient artillery is essential. To
win a battle with badly trained or inefficient artillery
is now a matter of extreme difficulty. I will not
venture to lay down the exact proportion of guns
necessary per 1,000 infantry, but there must be, at
any rate, not less than 6 guns per 1,000 (<i>i.e.</i> one
battery to each complete battalion).</p>

<p>What an error we committed in posting our
artillery on the crests of the hills! The Japanese
punished us very severely for the mistake, but it
was too late then to change our dispositions.</p>

<p>The Japanese batteries were completely concealed,
and fired on our skirmishers as deliberately
as if they were at practice on their artillery ranges.
They had a lot of work in front of them yet, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as we could still hold on to those positions we had
spent some time in fortifying, and the 5th Regiment
had yet many trying moments to live through.</p>

<p>Much had to be done on 203 Metre Hill in order
to enable our troops to hold out under a veritably
hellish fire, with which our gunners were powerless
to cope.</p>

<p>From the capture of the advanced hills until the
morning of August 19 we worked on our positions
almost without molestation, the enemy devoting
all his attention to 174 Metre Hill (<a href="#map_2">See Map II.</a>).
Being convinced that the next serious attack would
be made on that hill, we did all in our power to put
it into a good state of defence. The left flank
was covered by a wire entanglement, the front was
strengthened by a 3-foot revetment, and the right
flank had a double line of trenches, the upper tier
of which was blinded.</p>

<p>On the top of the hill solid shelters were built for
the gunners and a round trench was made, with a
considerable number of blinded traverses, which were
not, however, very solidly constructed.</p>

<p>The summit of the hill on the left flank (which we
called the Connecting Ridge) was lined with trenches.
On the reverse slopes of the hill a magazine, very
solidly made, was constructed for gun and rifle
ammunition, and cover was also provided there,
sufficient for a whole reserve company. In rear of the
hill (174 Metre Hill) there were four field mortars,
and on the crest, for long-range firing, two long
naval guns (I do not remember their exact calibre,
but I think it was 150 mm.) with steel shields, in
a well-constructed battery, and behind the crest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
four field quick-firers. On the saddle between 174
Metre Hill and Connecting Ridge were Lieutenant
Tsvietkov’s two quick-firers.</p>

<p>The garrison of 174 Metre Hill consisted of the 5th
and 9th Companies of the 5th Regiment (about 300
men), while the 6th, 10th, 11th, and 12th Companies
of the same, and one company of the 24th Regiment
were on Connecting Ridge.</p>

<p>There were on Namako Yama at this time:
on the left flank, the 1st Company of the 28th Regiment
under Major Sakatski, the 11th Company of the
13th Regiment, the 5th and 6th Companies of the
Kuang-tung Battalion, and the 12th Company of
the 13th Regiment. It must be admitted that the
trenches here were not sufficiently strong to afford
much protection against the Japanese Shimose and
shrapnel, and heavy losses were expected. But
what could be done? We had neither the time nor
the tools necessary to deal with that rocky soil, and
thus to improve matters.</p>

<p>A battery had been placed on the top of 174 Metre
Hill, instead of an infantry redoubt. This battery
was in position before the 5th Regiment occupied
the hill. I wanted to convert it into a redoubt, but
my senior officers refused to sanction the proposal,
as, in General Bieli’s<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> opinion, there was no other
position for long-range guns. How much time and
trouble we spent on completing this battery, while
the real defenders had to crowd into the small unfinished
trenches! I may add that the guns posted
in this battery had a large area of dead ground, and
drew on themselves the fire of the Japanese heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>artillery, which considerably interfered with our
work. I was nearly killed by a shell bursting near
me, and escaped by a miracle with no greater hurt
than a blow in the side from a large clod of earth.</p>

<p>On the fall of the advanced positions the garrison
of 174 Metre Hill had to live in the trenches, whereas
before they had been encamped on the reverse slope
of the hill. Field kitchens had been well built in a
ravine, and others on the reverse slope.</p>

<p>The men lived in large field tents, and the officers
in an improvised barrack, built of planks.</p>

<p>Strenuous efforts had been made to construct a
road leading from the top of the hill, and an enormous
amount of energy had likewise been expended in
making roads to the principal hills—203 Metre,
Namako Yama, and Akasaka Yama. To this
end we had been working hard ever since the
arrival of the 5th Regiment at 174 Metre Hill, at
which time there existed only one small path over
203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>By its fire, and by the posting of a detachment to
prevent Height 426 from being outflanked from the
left, 174 Metre Hill was a source of considerable
annoyance to the Japanese, so, in attacking the
advanced hills, they did not forget it.</p>

<p>On August 14,<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
at 4.15 a.m., the enemy opened a
tremendous fire on 174 Metre Hill, and kept it up
till 5 o’clock in the evening. On this day Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Andreiev, commanding the artillery on the hill, was
wounded by four splinters.</p>

<p>At 1.15 a.m. on August 15 the enemy advanced on
174 Metre Hill from the front and from the left flank.
Firing continued till 3.15 a.m., when the Japanese
retreated, but a heavy bombardment broke out
again at 4.30 a.m. and continued till 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>This bombardment was renewed at 4 p.m., continuing
till 7 p.m. As a result some of our splinter-proofs
were destroyed and also part of our trenches.</p>

<p>On August 16 the Japanese did not fire at all,
possibly through want of ammunition, we ourselves
taking advantage of the occasion to rebuild our
trenches. About 9 p.m. desultory rifle fire broke out
under the hill, and the enemy’s skirmishing line appeared
about 1,200 paces away, while behind, in
complete silence, marched the storming columns.
The defenders of the hills threw down their digging
tools, stood to their posts, and opened fire in volleys.</p>

<p>The storming columns moved away, now to the
right, now to the left, and finally took cover in the
defile on the left. This was at about 11 p.m., and
our men sat in the trenches all night expecting
another attack. We expended 12,000 rounds of
ammunition.</p>

<p>On August 17 and 18 our men rebuilt the trenches
under heavy rifle fire.</p>

<p>On the 17th the trenches were completed to the
required profile, but a heavy bombardment was then
opened on the hill. Our guns tried to answer the
fire from the hills, but could not locate the batteries
that were destroying them, and the Japanese soldiers
only showed themselves when out of range. Our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
field guns were therefore put under cover, and I
still regret that it was impossible to put those
150-mm. guns under cover as well.</p>

<p>On August 18 the firing upon the hill increased
considerably in volume, and our trenches and splinter-proofs
began to suffer severely. Lieutenant-Colonel
Leesaevski, who was commandant of the hill, reported
that he expected an attack, so I moved our reserves
to 203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>At night fierce hand-to-hand fighting took place
round the base of the hill between the Japanese and
our patrols who were forming the outpost line—a
sure sign of a coming attack.</p>

<p>On the night of August 18–19 the Japanese moved
in great strength up to 174 Metre Hill and lay down
behind the crests of the nearest hillocks. Lieutenant-Colonel
Leesaevski had the whole garrison on the
alert, and opened fire as soon as the columns showed
themselves over the crests beyond. The enemy
made several attempts to come to close quarters, but
without avail. On the alarm sounding, star-rockets
were fired from 203 Metre and Division Hills, and
our search-lights came into play for the first time.
The scene was a terrible, but, at the same time, an
exhilarating one. Discovered by the beams of light,
the Japanese hastily retired over the crest, leaving a
great number of dead in front of 174 Metre Hill.
After several attempts they ceased their attacks,
and the rest of the night passed in petty encounters
and outpost skirmishes.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of August 19, just as day
was breaking, I was awakened by a fearful cannonade.
Running out of my room, I saw a pall of smoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
from bursting shrapnel hanging over 174 Metre Hill.
In order to find out what was happening, I galloped
over to Akasaka Yama. However, when I got there,
I was no better off than before, so I went to the left
flank of Namako Yama. A dense skirmishing line
was advancing on the right of 174 Metre Hill, and
lines of skirmishers and columns of troops were
moving towards the centre, occasionally taking cover
in the valleys and then again appearing on the ridges.
The rattle of rifle fire from our companies on Connecting
Ridge could be heard on the left flank. The
main attack was delivered against the left of 174
Metre Hill, but it was not within my field of view.
The lines advanced so skilfully that our guns were
unable to range on them, though they suffered heavily
from rifle fire. Orderlies with reports were galloping
away from 174 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>In order to meet them, I again returned to Akasaka
Yama, where Colonel Irman joined me.</p>

<p>Wishing to be at the centre of the hills attacked,
and within easy reach of orderlies, we changed our
position to a hillock situated between Namako Yama
and Connecting Ridge. We also thought that this
would be a favourable point for making observations,
but, as a matter of fact, it was rather the reverse,
because all shell falling “over” landed in this
very locality. We posted the reserve (the 7th Company
of the 28th Regiment) behind the left flank of
Namako Yama.</p>

<p>From 203 Metre Hill we sent a telephone message
to the officer commanding the artillery, directing
him to concentrate every available gun on the slopes
in front of 174 Metre Hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour our guns boomed forth,
and shells of every size began to fall on the ground
indicated by us. The Japanese gun fire smothered
174 Metre Hill, and a continuous stream of wounded
flowed back towards 203 Metre Hill, where the chief
dressing station was situated. This fierce bombardment
continued until about four o’clock. We had
lost heavily. The whole of the rear of the hill
attacked was literally strewn with shell. I was
rather badly hit in the left side by a stone thrown up
by a bursting shell.</p>

<p>Seeing that the right flank of Connecting Ridge
was the most probable point of attack (there was a
good deal of dead ground from our guns in front of
it), and that a very heavy artillery fire was now
being directed there, I sent the 7th Company of the
28th Regiment, under Major Frantz, to stand in
reserve behind it.</p>

<p>About four o’clock the firing reached its zenith.
The Japanese advanced to the attack, not in columns
but in large groups, but they failed to get up to the
trenches. Hundreds of them were mown down, and
it seemed to me that the attack had failed everywhere.
What was our surprise, when we received
a report from Major Astafiev, commanding the 10th
Company,<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> that his half-company had been wiped
out, save ten men, and that the Japanese had occupied
his empty trenches during the attack. The
remaining ten men, however, had not retreated (they
were separated from the captured trench by a cliff),
but had stuck to their trench. I then and there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>made a mental vow that the deeds of these heroes
should eventually be put on record in letters of gold
as a perpetual memorial to the 10th Company, and
I now redeem my pledge.</p>

<p>The trench occupied by the Japanese was under
the cliff, and it was a very difficult matter to climb
down into it. As we had no further reserves available,
I sent to 203 Metre Hill for two half-companies
(2nd and 4th of our regiment), hoping to drive the
Japanese out of the trench with these men. I also
sent to General Kondratenko for reinforcements.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Leesaevski reported from 174
Metre Hill that the Japanese had run up one by one,
had established themselves within a few paces of
the trenches, and were throwing stones at our riflemen,
who returned the missiles.</p>

<p>At about six o’clock we collected two companies
of the 13th Regiment, and made an attack on about
100 Japanese then in the trenches of the 10th
Company. The companies quickly reached the top
of the cliff, but got no farther, as it was a big drop
down below. The Japanese artillery, noticing them,
at once opened a heavy fire, and as it thus became
impossible to remain there in the open the companies
retreated again into the valley.</p>

<p>At about seven o’clock General Kondratenko joined
us, and four companies of the 13th Regiment arrived,
the 2nd, 6th, 7th, and 9th, under the command of
the battalion commanders Majors Goosakovski and
Gavreelov.</p>

<p>We decided that the Japanese must be driven out
of the 10th Company’s trenches, and, with that object
in view, I reinforced these men, who had already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
resisted several attacks, with one more company.
The attack was repeated, but with the same result
(it was a big jump down, right on to the bayonets
of the Japanese, who were invisible from the
top, while the guns from the heights beyond
mowed down the attackers). This time half of the
men lodged themselves behind stones on the top, and
I now felt sure that the Japanese would not take the
hill, as it would be very difficult for them to climb
up the cliff. In order to minimize our losses from
gun fire, I decided on a night attack, and sent one
company, under Major Goosakovski, to carry it out.</p>

<p>I ordered back half a company of the 5th Regiment
to its original position.</p>

<p>It transpired that the 7th Company of the 28th
Regiment was not in its correct place, having for
some reason retired behind 174 Metre Hill. I did not
see when Major Frantz carried out this movement.</p>

<p>All this time the firing and bombardment on
174 Metre Hill continued, and our forces dwindled
away rapidly.</p>

<p>Reinforcements being demanded, a Scout Detachment
under Captain Osmanov, which had only just
come up, was sent there. This detachment, with
its commander at its head, steadily and quietly
ascended the hill, five men excepted, who tailed off
at the foot of the hill, evidently afraid to go on. I
did not order them to ascend the hill, knowing
from experience that the presence of a few cowards
may unsettle the very bravest company.</p>

<p>The stream of wounded from the hill increased,
and many of these poor sufferers expired while being
carried across the shell-strewn ground. We saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
one wounded man, who was being carried by two of
our clerks, killed by a shell falling right on top of him.
One of his bearers was killed too, but the other escaped
as by a miracle. A large group of wounded
now went past me, and behind them an officer on a
stretcher. He was a very young gunner, and he
kept waving his sword in a frenzy and muttering
something. I do not remember what he said, as
my attention was attracted by another stretcher,
on which was an officer whom I thought I knew.</p>

<p>When the stretcher came close, I recognized in
the wounded man Lieutenant-Colonel Leesaevski,
who had been commandant of the hill. He was
covered with blood and dust. A bullet had shattered
his lower jaw and tongue, and another had struck
his hand. He could not speak from loss of blood.</p>

<p>In his absence things might go badly on the hill.</p>

<p>This seasoned warrior had always shown extraordinary
energy combined with method. He was nicknamed
“General Fock” in the regiment, which for
some reason displeased the real general, so, instead
of commanding a regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Leesaevski
was given the command of the 2nd Battalion
of the 5th Regiment. General Fock never recognized
the great spirit animating this man, which showed
up so prominently in the defence of 174 Metre Hill.
The old Colonel was indeed a far finer soldier than
many of the younger ones.</p>

<p>He fearlessly walked about the hill, encouraging
the men and directing their fire, closely following
the movements of the enemy, and then, bringing up
his small reserve just at the right moment, he scattered
the thick columns of attackers like chaff before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
wind by a few well-directed volleys. When the men
wanted to take him to the dressing station, he said:
“Leave me alone, my lads; I want to die with you.”
With a heavy heart I accompanied the stretcher,
fearing that a stray bullet or shell might end the
career of this magnificent old soldier. But, thank
God! he got safely across the pass to 203 Metre Hill,
which meant that he was out of harm’s way. In
his place I appointed Captain Bielozerov, commanding
the 9th Company of the 5th Regiment, one of the
bravest of our officers.</p>

<p>Towards evening more reinforcements were called
for from 174 Metre Hill. The defenders were so
worn out that they could not repair the damage
done, which was considerable. The upper battery
was destroyed, all the field guns were dismounted,
and the gun-pits reduced to ruins. Nearly all the
splinter-proofs in the trenches were destroyed, as
well as half of the parapet. The whole of the overhead
cover against shrapnel was also wrecked by
shell fire.</p>

<p>It is difficult to defend such places without casemated
works. On a hill commanded from all sides
what can riflemen do against heavy artillery, and
the high-explosive shell of field guns? During this
day the 5th and 9th Companies of the 5th Regiment
lost half their strength.</p>

<p>Gun fire slackened. The stream of wounded also
ceased, and we breathed more freely. Our party
on the central hillock was joined by some reserve
officers, and eventually we even had something to eat.</p>

<p>Meat, bread, and hot tea were supplied to the men
in the lines, and the field kitchen on the other side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of 174 Metre Hill, which had escaped untouched,
got to work.</p>

<p>General Kondratenko brought up two more companies
to the reserve and sent two companies of the
13th Regiment to the hill to work at the trenches.</p>

<p>We laughed at the Japanese who had taken the
10th Company’s trench, and must by now be feeling
like rats in a trap. The half of the 1st Company
of the 13th Regiment who had been left there, and
the ten men of the 10th Company, prevented them
from spreading along the trench, while in front their
road was barred by those standing on the hill, so
that it appeared inevitable that they must all be
killed that night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile night had already fallen. The usual
night firing had started between the outposts at
the foot of the hills, and the resulting noise would
cover the advance of our attacking companies. I
sent to ask why the attack had not commenced,
and was kept waiting for an answer for a very long
time. The night was very dark. Everything was
quiet, till now and again the enemy’s bullets, like birds
of the night, hummed high overhead, or our star-rockets,
strange hissing monsters, like fiery snakes
shot up into the sky and burst into a thousand dazzling
stars, brilliantly illuminating the dark hills and
valleys.</p>

<p>“The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.” This
proverb was exemplified in us and in our men. How
many times have we not been witnesses of the truth
of it! how many times have not the Japanese taken
advantage of the utter exhaustion of our troops,
fallen upon them when they lay asleep, and captured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
important points in our position (as at Ta-ku Shan,
Miortvaia Sopka,<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
and other places)!</p>

<p>We realize now what it means to defend a fortress
lacking a main line of defence and having an insufficient
number of permanently fortified positions.
Now I can clearly see that open field works, even
though prepared for some time in advance, and
with trenches strengthened with glacis parapets (as
Glinka-Yarnchevski proposed at one time), will not
give the defenders facilities for sufficient rest; and
rest is a very important factor.</p>

<p>We were so tired that day—a fact not to be wondered
at—that we lay down where we were and went to
sleep. Heavy rifle firing brought us to our feet again.
Star-rockets shot into the air and lit up the place,
and caused the firing to die down once more. We
received word from those on the hill that they had
been firing on the Japanese, who had destroyed
some of the wire entanglements. There were not
many of them, but they had nevertheless caused a
good deal of damage, and then had crouched down
near the line of wires. It was unfortunate that they
had succeeded to such an extent. I sent orders for
the damage to be repaired as far as possible, but I
knew our men on the hill were handicapped owing
to lack of barbed wire.</p>

<p>This barbed wire was literally worth its weight
in gold, and I was always delighted when we succeeded
in getting some for the defence of this or that point,
but there was great need of it everywhere.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>There were several of these alarms during the night,
but all this time Major Goosakovski’s attack on the
Japanese failed to come off.</p>

<p>However, I received a note at last, saying that he
had decided to attack at daybreak.</p>

<p>Having quietly thought the matter out, I came
to the conclusion that the Japanese might be left
in the trench. These 100 men could not climb up
and take the hill, which was defended by a whole
company, neither could they be reinforced, as any
reinforcements would be annihilated before they
reached them. I told Colonel Irman, who was sitting
near me, what I thought, and as he quite agreed with
me, I sent an order cancelling the attack, and withdrew
the companies, except the one behind the rocks,
to a more sheltered spot between 174 Metre Hill
and Connecting Ridge. One of these companies
I placed in reserve behind 174 Metre Hill, so that
there were now three companies in the reserve, <i>i.e.</i>
at the immediate disposal of the officer in command
on the hill. The two companies which had arrived
in the evening I assigned to the general reserve.
There were a few hours left till dawn, of which we
took advantage to get some sleep, repairing to Namako
Yama, so as not to be disturbed by the groans of
the badly wounded men as they were being carried
along the road.</p>

<p>Our bearers (bandsmen, regimental clerks, and
volunteers from the town) sought them out during
the night in the ravines, trenches, and ruined blindages,<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
and carried them to 203 Metre Hill.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>Before the sun had risen, the enemy’s guns began
their work of destruction, the worst of it being that
they did it without receiving any punishment in
return.</p>

<p>Little by little, rifle firing broke out. When it
was quite light, the companies on Connecting Ridge
noticed a Japanese battery coming into action at
very close range. They opened fire in volleys, and
the battery retired with heavy loss. Second-Lieutenant
Bitzouk, who was for the second time wounded
in the leg, was chiefly responsible for the destruction
of this battery.</p>

<p>After this battery had retired, the infantry commenced
their attack, and towards seven o’clock there
was very heavy rifle firing.</p>

<p>All the company commanders on Connecting Ridge
were placed <i>hors de combat</i>, and the three companies
were commanded by Acting Ensign Agapov. I
called for volunteers from the staff for the command
of these companies, and in response to my call Lieutenant
Vaseeliev and Second-Lieutenant Galileiev
at once stepped forward.</p>

<p>At 8 a.m. General Kondratenko arrived, and found
that everything was satisfactory. But the firing
and bombardment had not slackened.</p>

<p>About 11 a.m. it was reported from the hill that
the enemy was attacking from the left flank, and
that Acting Ensign Shishkin had been killed.</p>

<p>I immediately telephoned to the officer commanding
the artillery to again concentrate his fire on the
valley in front of 174 Metre Hill, and soon our
shells were streaming in the required direction.
But still the Japanese guns vomited death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>A report now came in from the troops on the
hill that their trenches were absolutely destroyed.
They asked for not less than one company to reinforce
them, as there were very few of the original
defenders left. I myself saw that their last reserves
had been used, and a long line of wounded streamed
down from the hill, amongst whom was the new
commandant, Captain Bielozerov. When brought to
my vicinity, he was in a fearful condition; a bullet
had struck him on the right side of the chest and
passed right through, his shirt being soaked with
blood. He passed quite close to me and whispered
to me: “Send up a company at once. Put Second-Lieutenant
Ivanov in command.”</p>

<p>Second-Lieutenant Ivanov was one of my bravest
officers. When volunteers were called for to collect
the wounded on Height 426, he said he would go with
twenty-five men who had also volunteered under
Lieutenant Alalikin of the battleship <i>Poltava</i>. When
they reached the Japanese outpost line, they saw
that it was impossible for the whole detachment to
get through, whereupon Second-Lieutenant Ivanov
crawled through the enemy’s lines alone and found
a wounded artillery non-commissioned officer, whom
he hoisted upon his shoulder and brought back. On
his way back he met Serpukov, a lance-corporal
of the 9th Company, who had got through safely,
and between them they carried the wounded man
to their detachment, and thence to 174 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>I immediately sent an order to Second-Lieutenant
Ivanov to consider himself in command on the hill.</p>

<p>The loss of Lieutenant-Colonel Leesaevski and
Captain Bielozerov was irreparable. The latter was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
a real hero. On August 20 there was a moment on
174 Metre Hill when the sections of the 28th and
13th Regiments<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> on the left flank wavered and turned
their backs. Captain Bielozerov rushed in amongst
the fugitives, and with a few impassioned words,
pointing out to them the shame they would bring
on their regiments, made them return to their posts.
Captain Bielozerov was wounded when he sprang
out of the trench to see where the enemy was and
what he was doing.</p>

<p>It was only possible to hold the hill at the price
of heavy losses, but we decided that it was worth it.
Hence I resolved to go myself to the hill, and to send
up our last reserves.</p>

<p>At this moment E. P. Balashov, the medical officer
in charge of the hospital, rode up with his assistant,
M. Tordan, a French subject, and accompanied by
General Fock. These unexpected arrivals put new
spirit into us.</p>

<p>We were all struck with the bravery and coolness
of E. P. Balashov, who was a great favourite in the
regiment. Bullets were whistling by in sufficient
numbers to try the nerves of any man who had not
previously been under fire, in spite of which our
civilian general<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and his companion did not appear
to experience the slightest sensation of fear.</p>

<p>General Fock did not fail to give us his opinion on
the position of affairs, and he declared that the hill
<i>must</i> be held anyhow till nightfall. This was already
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>quite obvious to all of us. It is a very nasty thing
to retreat by day under the fire of an enemy who is
only a few paces off. But General Kondratenko
expressed the wish to hold the hill for an indefinite
length of time, notwithstanding the fact that it would
be more than difficult to remain there under a hail
of large and small shells without any cover from their
murderous effect.</p>

<p>About twelve o’clock a rifleman ran down from the
hill with a note from Second-Lieutenant Ivanov. He
demanded immediate reinforcements, and as many
as possible, saying that both officers and men were
beginning to waver; hence it was obviously necessary
to send up help at once.</p>

<p>I knew that Second-Lieutenant Ivanov would not
ask for reinforcements without good reason. I reported
this to General Kondratenko (we had one
company left in the reserve), and it was decided to
send the required reinforcements. But General Fock
heard the order given, and fired up at our “inexperience.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” said he. “You want to
hold on until nightfall, and yet you send up your last
reserve?”</p>

<p>“It is absolutely necessary,” I answered.</p>

<p>“It is not at all necessary,” declared General Fock.</p>

<p>“All right, Nicholai Alexandrovitch,” said General
Kondratenko, turning to me; “we will wait a little
longer.”</p>

<p>I saw that General Fock’s assurance had overruled
General Kondratenko’s judgment, and I had not the
moral courage myself to contradict him and insist
on the despatch of the last company, the more so, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Colonel Irman, my immediate superior, did not give
me any support.</p>

<p>About half an hour passed since the reinforcements
had been asked for. Balashov and M. Tordan
departed saying that they had had quite enough of
it, and General Fock also rode off. Meanwhile the
struggle grew fiercer and fiercer, and now the first
signs of wavering became evident.</p>

<p>I noticed three riflemen running away from the
hill, and three men without rifles behind them. I
drew General Kondratenko’s attention to them, and
he evidently realized his mistake, for he said to me:
“Ah! now it is too late!” Then behind the second
group of three men there quickly followed about
twenty others, and soon an entire company poured
down the hill after them.</p>

<p>On the hill itself men were running in all directions,
like ants whose hill has been disturbed, but a group
of about fifty men rushed into the upper battery,
stood upon the breastwork, and fired straight down
on the enemy below. In front of this group,
holding his naked sword in his hand, I saw our Acting
Ensign Shchenakin, and my heart swelled with pride
for the 5th Regiment. All these men belonged to
the 5th Regiment, and they had not lost hope of
holding the hill, although every one else had fled.</p>

<p>At this moment the enemy opened a hellish fire
on this group of heroes, wreathing the hill in clouds
of smoke; the Japanese, by the way, never thought
twice about firing over the heads of their own men.
I did not see what was the end, for we all—General
Kondratenko, Colonel Irman, and myself—galloped
off to stop the retreat, and, though the task was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
an easy one, we nevertheless succeeded. I placed the
reserve near our central hill, and the troops who had
retreated occupied a position in touch with this
reserve, from Namako Yama to Connecting Ridge.
A telephone message was sent off at once, ordering
the artillery to direct as many guns as possible on
174 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>The yellow-caps had already shown themselves on
the crest and opened a fairly heavy, though not very
accurate, fire on us.</p>

<p>At this moment the crest of the hill was swept by
such a terrific storm of our shells, that everything
living was destroyed in a few seconds, and the
Japanese did not dare to show themselves even after
the firing had ceased.</p>

<p>It is a very difficult matter to hold ordinary field
trenches against siege artillery placed at short range.</p>

<p>With the fall of 174 Metre Hill we saw that it was
impossible to hold on to Connecting Ridge, which
had, therefore, to be evacuated. General Kondratenko
gave the order to do so, and then went home,
as he was utterly worn out and could hardly stand,
Colonel Irman going away with him.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese
did not dare to show themselves on 174 Metre Hill,
I quietly withdrew the companies from Connecting
Ridge, and posted them for the time being behind
Namako Yama and Division Hill.</p>

<p>On August 19 and 20 the 5th Company lost 62 killed
and wounded, about half its then strength. The
9th lost 120 men, and had only 48 left in the ranks.
Our companies were the last to retreat.</p>

<p>Our losses during the defence of 174 Metre Hill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
amounted to 1,000 men, of whom about one-third
were killed.</p>

<p>Considering that this loss was incurred chiefly on
174 Metre Hill and Connecting Ridge, where only
four companies (800 men at the most) could act at a
time, the loss of 1,000 men at one point will give
some idea of the volume of fire developed at this
spot by the Japanese.</p>

<p>If we had decided to retake the hill, it would not
have been a difficult matter, but it would have cost
us more than 500 men a day to hold it, as we should
not have been able to reconstruct the trenches to
keep pace with the amount of damage done day after
day; my regiment would only have sufficed for
four days, since, including the details from the 28th
Regiment, our strength was no more than 1,800 men.</p>

<p>As is evident from the foregoing narrative, when
necessity arose, units from other regiments were sent
to me, but they were often required for other
positions of the defensive line.</p>

<p>Besides 1,000 casualties, we lost 2 long 150-mm.
guns, 4 field guns, 2 machine guns, and 4 field mortars.
However, two of these were recaptured by us during
the final attacks at the foot of 174 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>With the fall of 174 Metre Hill it became immediately
necessary to strengthen the trenches on
Division Hill, Namako Yama, Akasaka Yama, and
203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>These trenches were far from complete, except
those on 203 Metre Hill, where they were made with
splinter-proofs and light cover from shrapnel shell,
and were furnished with wire entanglements.</p>

<p>But our experience on 174 Metre Hill had taught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
us how weak our earth-works were in comparison
with the destructive power of the enemy’s shells,
and so it was evidently necessary to strengthen
considerably all the fortifications on 203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>All this should have been done earlier, but want of
tools and men had prevented us during the defence
from working at any but the advanced positions.
203 Metre Hill was an exception, as, being one of
the most important points if not <i>the</i> most important,
on the defensive line, it had received my special
attention.</p>

<p>We had to set to work again night and day. This
is what I proposed to do: to throw the four trenches
on Namako Yama into one long trench the whole
length of the hill; to make several communication
trenches back to the rear of the hill, where splinter-proofs
were to be built and tents erected for those
defending the hill; to build kitchens and establish a
dressing station at the foot of the hill close to the
battery of long 6-inch guns; to construct a magazine
for small-arm ammunition, shell, and cartridges, and
also make a dug-out for the commandant. I furthermore
proposed to convert the trench on the top of
Akasaka Yama into a redoubt, and to make several
trenches in front of it along the hill; to strengthen
all the splinter-proofs on 203 Metre Hill; and to place
solid timber baulks to hold up the head-cover, so
that the splinter-proofs would remain standing, even
though the parapet was blown away.</p>

<p>We set to work on our task the first night after the
capture of 174 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>The troops on the positions occupied by us were
disposed as follows: On Division Hill, the 5th, 7th,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and 11th Companies of the 5th Regiment, with the
2nd and 3rd Scout Detachments of the 5th Regiment
and the 9th Company of the 27th Regiment, under
Major Beedenko. On Namako Yama, two companies
of Marines, under our own officers, Afanaisev and
Siedelnitski, both companies under the command of
Lieutenant Shcherbachev; the 7th Company of the
28th Regiment and the 2nd Scout Detachment of the
same regiment, under Major Sokkatski; also one
company of the 13th Regiment and the 9th Company
of the 5th Regiment.<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> A section of Marines defended
Extinct Volcano. On 203 Metre Hill, as before,
there were the 2nd and 4th Companies of the 5th
Regiment, and I had three companies of the 4th Reserve
Battalion in reserve. All worked at night, and
slept during the day.</p>

<p>We were very much stronger now that our defensive
line was so much smaller, and I no longer feared
sudden attacks. But the following regrettable incident
again disturbed my peace of mind.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of August 23, I was awakened
to hear a report that the Japanese had taken Extinct
Volcano in the night.</p>

<div class="center-img-landscape" id="image_Page_136">
  <img src="images/i_b_136fp_600x328.jpg" width="600" height="328" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="x-small">EXTINCT VOLCANO: TAKEN FROM THE RIGHT FLANK OF NAMAKO YAMA.</p>
    <p class="x-small left">p. 136]</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I would not at first believe it, as the firing must
have been heard, and the night had passed absolutely
quietly.</p>

<p>When I said so to the orderly, he told me that there
had been no firing, as the Marines had been caught
asleep.</p>

<p>It turned out afterwards that they were not asleep,
but were working, and had been taken by surprise
because they had failed to put out outposts. Extinct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Volcano had two trenches on it—one near the foot,
for a half-company, and the other on the crest, for
a section. Three days before, I had sent half a company
of Marines to this hill for work and defence.</p>

<p>Owing to their ignorance of outpost work, they
had put out no standing sentries by night, but were
content with a few sentries on the trenches themselves.</p>

<p>Noticing their negligence, a small body of Japanese
had crept up to the drowsy sentries, surprised
them, and sprung into the trench.</p>

<p>Our Marines only grasped the situation when the
majority of them had already been killed. The
remainder fled to the upper trench, where there
was one sub-division of riflemen (I do not now
remember to whom they belonged—possibly the 7th
Company of the 28th Regiment, as they occupied
the right flank of Namako Yama). The Japanese
ran up behind them and burst into the trench at
their very heels, thus taking Extinct Volcano without
noise or firing.</p>

<p>Major Zimmermann—a hero in the true sense of
the word—in command on Namako Yama, hearing
what had happened, immediately organized a counter-attack,
and when the men had somewhat recovered
themselves, set them an example by rushing forward
with drawn sword. The soldiers followed him to a
man, and Extinct Volcano was retaken. Unfortunately,
Major Zimmermann was wounded in the arm
and breast, and had to relinquish his command.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after the recapture of the hill, the
enemy’s artillery opened a terrific fire on it.</p>

<p>By this time I had reached the scene of action,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
having with me one of the reserve companies, which
I ordered to remain on the site of the former bivouacs
of the regimental staff, near the graves of Colonel
Petrov and Major Schiller.</p>

<p>Reaching the top of Namako Yama, the nearest
point to Extinct Volcano, I saw that the yellow-peaked
caps were on its summit. This meant that
the enemy’s fire had driven us off the hill, which
proved, indeed, to be the case.</p>

<p>I sent a report to that effect.</p>

<p>At this moment Colonel Irman arrived with his
adjutant, and told me that he had sent for three
companies from the general reserve.</p>

<p>But at least an hour would pass before they could
arrive, and in that time the enemy would be able
to dig himself in, and it would be very difficult
to drive him out again.</p>

<p>We therefore decided to attack the hill without
delay, and with this object I ordered the 1st Scout
Detachment to come to me immediately (it was
stationed near Fort Yi-tzu Shan). Everything was
quiet there, and I felt I could withdraw troops from
that position without the fear of any hostile
attacks.</p>

<p>Colonel Irman telephoned to the officer commanding
the fortress artillery to open fire on the top of
Extinct Volcano with as many guns as he could get
to bear.</p>

<p>Our guns thundered out, and a hail of shell swept
the top of the hill. In a moment the hill was wreathed
in smoke, and the yellow-peaks disappeared.</p>

<p>In order to see what was happening on the reverse
side of the hill, I went into a ravine in front of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the left flank of Division Hill. Our cannonade
continued.</p>

<p>Just as I reached my new point of observation,
I had a very alarming experience. I heard the
shriek of a heavy shell over my head, and a moment
later it fell about 10 paces from me; the earth shook
from the deafening reverberation of the explosion,
and I was thrown heavily to the ground, covered
with sand and lumps of clay. It was some time before
I recovered from the shock and could continue my way.</p>

<p>This was due to one of our own 11-inch guns on the
coast forts. It was laid on the hill occupied by the
enemy, but the shell dropped near me—by no means
the first instance of our coast-defence guns giving
us an unpleasant surprise. An 11-inch shell once
landed in the 6th Company’s trench on Division
Hill. Luckily, there were no serious consequences
from these mishaps.<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>On reaching the left flank of Division Hill, I found
that the valley was not visible to me. I shouted up
to Division Hill, telling those there to inform me if
there was anything to be seen behind Extinct Volcano,
and soon received the answer that there were no
hostile troops in the valley.</p>

<p>The Japanese, however, caught sight of me from
their trenches and lost no time in firing at me, which
was pleasant indeed. They even started shelling
me with their field guns; they had, seemingly, an
enormous supply of rifle and gun ammunition, and
certainly used it freely.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>When I returned to Colonel Irman, our scouts
had already arrived, and we decided to attack without
delay. The scouts, with one company from the reserve
(the 5th of the 27th Regiment), were to advance
directly on the hill, while one company from the
garrison of Namako Yama moved from the flank. It
was a hard climb up the high steep hill, and continued
for some time without the enemy firing a
shot, our guns meanwhile sweeping the summit.
When, however, the scouts got close up, and likewise
the company from Namako Yama, our guns
ceased firing, upon which the yellow-peaks immediately
again crowned the hill.</p>

<p>The companies rushed forward. They reached
the parapet under a very heavy fire, but went no
farther, and lay down near it among the hollows in
the ground.</p>

<p>The opposing forces were so close to each other,
that they could easily throw stones across. The
yellow-peaks took cover behind the parapet, and our
men began to throw stones, as there was no possibility
of reaching them with bullets. The Japanese
replied in like fashion, and this continued for
some time.</p>

<p>We were quite accustomed to rifle and gun fire,
and it did not have much effect on us now, but this
stone-throwing produced a most childish impression;
it was annoying to think that there was not one man
sufficiently brave to show his comrades an example
by mounting the parapet, and the whole procedure
appeared futile to one anxiously awaiting an assault.</p>

<p>Eventually our men stopped throwing stones, and
were evidently preparing for a bayonet charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Several men dashed forward—an officer and some
non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>“Now, God with you!” said I to myself. “At
last they have pulled themselves together and are
swarming over the parapet.”</p>

<p>The yellow-peaks showed for a moment over the
crest of the parapet, then they were hidden by our
fellows, and with a wild “Hurrah” our companies
poured into the trench. Then all was silent.</p>

<p>“They’ve got it,” said Colonel Irman.</p>

<p>“Yes, we had it once before,” I answered, “but
nothing came of it, as their artillery drove us off
again. I reported Major Zimmermann’s success that
time; but now we will wait and see.” I had scarcely
finished speaking, when the Japanese began to sweep
the top of the hill with fire from their heavy
artillery.</p>

<p>We felt that nothing could be achieved until
these cursed guns were destroyed. But, forced to
husband their ammunition, our artillery hardly put
up any fight against the hostile batteries.</p>

<p>Shells of every calibre literally covered the top of
the hill, but our men did not come out of the trench.
It seemed strange indeed, as there were no splinter-proofs
in the small trench, and such a fire must destroy
all the defenders.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed and there was no sign of movement.
Another ten minutes and no retreat.</p>

<p>At last the enemy’s artillery ceased fire.</p>

<p>“Now,” I thought to myself, “the hill is ours.”
But a Japanese soldier with a flag suddenly appeared
on the parapet.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of that? Surely our men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
are not all killed?” But it was practically so.
The few that were left broke their way through to
Namako Yama. And the Japanese stood on the
parapet and waved his flag.</p>

<p>Just then reinforcements came in sight—a scout
detachment of some regiment. At their head was
Lieutenant Evstratov, a strongly built, tall, fair fellow
with a reddish beard. The men marched quickly
and joyously; but there were not more than eighty
of them.</p>

<p>“How is it you are so few—they promised me three
companies?”</p>

<p>“Here are the three companies, Colonel,” said
the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Where?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Here,” and he pointed to his men. “These are
worth more than three companies!”</p>

<p>We decided to add another small detachment that
came up behind the scouts, and attack as before,
sending yet another company from Namako Yama
on the flank. We accordingly sent an orderly to
Namako Yama with the necessary instructions. The
men who had just arrived did not know the ground,
so I took them on to the hill myself, and went with
them until they could all see how and where they
were to attack.</p>

<p>Our artillery again opened fire on Extinct Volcano,
and we saw the man with the flag jump down from
the parapet, while the summit of the volcano was
wreathed in smoke from our bursting shells. We
were evidently getting our revenge. After this I
returned to Colonel Irman.</p>

<p>There were very few attackers, and we impatiently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
awaited reinforcements, but none arrived, and already
the scouts had nearly reached the top, and firing had
commenced. The officer leapt on the parapet and
fired at some one with his revolver. All his men
followed him, and lay down on the glacis without
jumping down into the trench. Obviously the
Japanese were there.</p>

<p>No reinforcements had yet reached us. I could
not stand it, and ran to a hill lying behind us to see
if the companies were coming up, or if they had
halted anywhere.</p>

<p>To reach this hill I had to run across a fairly broad
ravine. As I went down into it, I heard the Japanese
firing on the hill, and as I reached my point of observation
I saw the reinforcing companies hurrying towards
us.</p>

<p>I returned to Colonel Irman with the good news,
but he soon put a damper on my spirits. “It’s no
good now, our men are all killed by shell fire.” Looking
towards the hill, I saw nothing but the dead
bodies of our gallant comrades.</p>

<p>The reserve companies reached us completely tired
out. Colonel Irman and I could not help acknowledging
that it was now impossible to retake the hill.</p>

<p>Having come to this conclusion, Colonel Irman
sent a report to that effect to General Kondratenko.</p>

<p>I heard afterwards that that splendid officer,
Lieutenant Evstratov, was wounded by a fragment
of shell and died in hospital.</p>

<p>Extinct Volcano remained in the hands of the
Japanese, and the piles of bodies, both Russian and
Japanese, served for the rest of the siege as a reproach
to our gunners, who were not strong enough to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the enemy from coming into action at decisive
ranges.</p>

<p>The defence of this hill was shorter than that of
174 Metre Hill; of course, there were reasons for this.
In the first place, the top of the hill was ten times
smaller than that of 174 Metre Hill, the trenches only
accommodating one section; and, secondly, there
was not a single splinter-proof on it, and the line of
trenches was beyond our general line of defence, and
had a certain amount of dead ground in front.</p>

<p>Our riflemen had no cover from artillery fire, and if
they did not retreat, were destroyed to a man. But
if we gave up this hill to the Japanese, we hoped that
they would not occupy it, because our artillery could
sweep them off, as theirs did our troops when we were
in possession. However, it did not turn out so.</p>

<p>When we told our gunners to drive the Japanese
from this hill, they answered that they had very
few shell and must keep them for more important
targets.</p>

<p>So the Japanese held our trenches unpunished, and
repaired them, making communication trenches and
cover from our bullets.</p>

<p>Colonel Irman gave me the companies that had
come up at the finish for strengthening the defences
on Namako Yama, and they were badly needed
by me.</p>

<p>What an enormous influence one man, whether
officer or private, can have on the issue of a battle!</p>

<p>In many battles I have noticed and studied the
psychological effect produced on an ordinary man
who is brought face to face with death.</p>

<p>The desire to escape from the danger threatening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
him is so great, that he is scarcely able to exhibit the
strength of will of even the average individual.</p>

<p>Overcome by this feeling, a man loses his power of
weighing circumstances, and he either acts from force
of habit, or else follows the example of his commander
or his neighbour. (This is a well-known phenomenon,
but it is brought home only to the man who has
been among soldiers during a fight.) Now, supposing
this neighbour loses his head and runs, there
are very few who will not follow his example; the
average man will take to his heels too, his neighbour
follows him, and so on, until the whole detachment is
retreating in disorder.</p>

<p>A disorderly retreat is always started by one man,
and in most cases this man is physically weak
and sometimes, though rarely, an obvious funk.
Therefore it is essential to recruit soldiers from men
who are physically strong, for almost every weak
man will be a cause of retreat and, consequently, of
defeat. A hundred picked men are preferable to
two or three hundred weak ones, even though the
latter are equally well trained.</p>

<p>I would add that men must learn how to husband
their strength. On a long march fatigued soldiers
are worse than useless. So I say that we must
discard most of what our soldiers now carry in their
knapsacks, and retain only the following articles:
1 shirt, 1 pair of trousers, 1 pair of putties, 1 pair of
socks, a ball of lint, a butter-tin, some needles and
thread, and sugar for two days. All the other things
are absolutely superfluous. Have your supply columns
perfect; but the soldier must go as light as possible,
and must, moreover, look smart, so that an enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
will not dare to call him a “ragged beggar.”<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Make
a soldier so smart that even a sloven will become
a rather fine-looking fellow. A smart outward appearance
raises the spirits of the troops.</p>

<p>It is also indispensable to teach the infantry
soldier field fortification thoroughly, so that he becomes
the equal of a sapper and needs no supervision
in war time. In the 5th Regiment, not only the
non-commissioned officers, but the men also, could
point out where trenches should be constructed,
and of what depth and length they should be.</p>

<p>Our men blamed the sappers for making trenches
with elbow rests, as they knew by experience what
the loss of that width of earth meant along the firing
line. They said that the sappers did it because they
had not themselves been under shrapnel fire, and
did not know how to take aim from behind cover.</p>

<p class="hang small">Continuing the work of fortifying the various hills—End of the first
general assault, August 22 and 23—Attacks on Namako Yama
from August 24 to September 19.</p>

<p class="noindent">As soon as Extinct Volcano had been surrendered to
the Japanese, I determined to strengthen our present
defences by means of trenches and wire entanglements,
and had the trenches on Namako Yama and Division
Hill extended and deepened accordingly.</p>

<p>I placed the 10th Company in the valley between
Extinct Volcano and Division Hill, hoping thereby
to fill up the gap between the hills occupied by us.</p>

<p>This done, we had next to set to work to fortify
Akasaka Yama, taking the task in hand without a
moment’s delay.</p>

<p>I had already commenced a redoubt capable of
accommodating one company on the top of Akasaka
Yama, which now required finishing, and, in addition,
it was necessary to build trenches round the hill for
five companies.</p>

<p>Keeping in view the possibility of the enemy
breaking through across Extinct Volcano, I fortified
the ground between Fort Yi-tzu Shan and Riji Hill<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>and made Division Hill and Namako Yama into two
independent commands. We also had to safeguard
our communications with Division Hill and Namako
Yama which might be exposed to attack. For all
this work we wanted tools, material, and men, and we
were again short of all three. Luckily, at this difficult
time Major Gemmelmann of the Engineers, as well as
several non-commissioned officers, was attached to
me, so I was able to get some sleep at night. I
collected a large store of <i>matériel</i> near the regimental
headquarter camp.</p>

<p>After many urgent messages the authorities concerned
began to send us wire, bags (for sand), all
sorts of iron and steel, and a few tools, and, as before,
we procured whatever else was wanted from the
stores in the town and from the railway people.</p>

<p>Our regimental horses became quite worn out
from hauling heavy materials, such as beams, planks,
rails, etc. We had very few carts and wagons for
carrying these things, as our baggage wagons were
mainly required for bringing up regimental necessaries
and stores needed to meet our daily wants.</p>

<p>It is an extraordinary thing how an important
fortress like Port Arthur could have been left almost
without any vehicles for general service, a want
which must be seen and felt to enable one to
understand rightly what sufficient transport means
in a fortress, and how indispensable it is.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the siege a light railway was
laid as far up as my headquarters, but was never
worked, probably owing to the want of trucks. I
saw the rails, but trucks were conspicuous by their
absence. A fortress, like an army, must have its own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
transport and the horses necessary for it, or, preferably,
be provided with good powerful motor vehicles.</p>

<p>I wanted to construct a splinter-proof observation
post for myself and Colonel Irman on one of our hills,
but again for want of transport we had to remain
throughout the siege at an observation station exposed
to the enemy’s fire. We always spent the
night at the regimental headquarters, where Colonel
Irman’s staff (he was in command of the whole of
the western front) also stayed. Our quarters were
buildings belonging to the Artillery Headquarters
Offices on Red Hill, and a large marquee pitched there
served as a mess-room, in which quite a number of
us sat down to dinner.</p>

<p>We seldom received any official visits from the
town, as we were not out of range of the enemy’s
bullets and shell. Two bandsmen were killed near
the building, and two wounded, as was also my
orderly, Private Ravinski.</p>

<p>However, General Nikizhin rode out fairly frequently
to sup with us, and we always looked forward
with pleasure to his visits. At all times in the best
of spirits, he was a clever and entertaining conversationalist,
and invariably brought us some piece
of interesting news, so that while he was with
us we forgot the monotony of our existence. From
him we learned how things were going on in the
other sections of the fortress, what attacks had been
beaten back, and the latest news of Kuropatkin’s
Army.</p>

<p>We used to get through an extraordinary amount
of tea, of which the officers, both regimental and
staff, had a plentiful supply, thank God! Our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
dinners were, however, becoming somewhat meagre—rice
soup and roast horse-flesh, with rice garnished
with rancid butter or tallow. Supper was of much
the same type. Occasionally when the men brought
us up a canteen full of “goltsies” (small, dark
fish), which they had caught in the horse-ponds, we
had a regular banquet.</p>

<p>When I went up to take observations from Red
Hill I often shot small birds sitting in the bushes
on the slopes of the hill, which we ate with
great relish. I think night-hawks, particularly,
are most delicious, and I do not know why we do
not eat more of them in the ordinary way of
living.</p>

<p>There was a small fir-wood behind Red Hill, towards
its northern side, which became my favourite place
for resting, and was a splendid observation point.
One could walk through this wood and breathe the
air, heavy with the odour of firs, and at the same
time see all the positions. On a bright sunny day
every man on the hills round could be seen, and the
occupations of the various units defending the positions
could be clearly observed. There, on Division
Hill, they would be preparing dinner in the kitchens
of the 7th Company; a little to the left, the dinners
of the 6th Company had already been served out;
and along the communication trench a whole company
was moving in relief of our scout detachments on
the left flank of Division Hill, who were in constant
touch with the Japanese.</p>

<p>Under Red Hill was a row of small ponds, used
as watering places for the artillery horses. They
were a source of real pleasure to our men, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
frequently bathed in them and fished, in spite
of bullets and shells constantly splashing into
them.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet on 203 Metre Hill, and I
was thankful that the Japanese were giving us time
to fortify it.</p>

<p>There was a harmless bombardment of Forts
Yi-tzu Shan and Ta-an-tzu Shan, all the shells
falling short of the former and passing over the
latter.</p>

<p>With what terrific force they burst! The gases
are not very noticeable, nor do they collect in one
large puff, but are whirled away in little streaks
scarcely visible to the eye, and then above a cloud
of black smoke is seen.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable thing that where the first
shell fell “short,” the others all fell short likewise;
if “over,” then the remainder fell over.</p>

<p>There was a road between Forts Chi-kuan and
Ehr-lung. Standing on this road, one could watch
the practice of a certain Japanese gun. The shells,
coming across the road from behind the hill, always
struck in exactly the same place, which was fought
shy of by every one, and this continued throughout
the siege, from the beginning to the end. The
soldiers used to joke about it, and say that it was
some gunner calibrating his gun.</p>

<p>Very few shells burst near my walk through the
wood. They all fell on the battery on Red Hill,
where Lieutenant Kornilovitch, a most gallant officer,
who came from Kiev to Colonel Petrov’s battery,
was killed.</p>

<p>I spent much time in the wood on Red Hill, living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
again through all that had passed, and trying not
to think of either the present or the future. I
always used to say to the men: “Never think
about what is <i>going</i> to happen to you, but only
about what <i>has</i> passed.”</p>

<p>I was frequently accompanied in my walks by
our doctor, Theodore Troitski. He was ever in
good spirits and full of jokes, could always find something
interesting to talk about, and so was much
sought after. In my spare time, when everything
was quiet, I often used to go to the dressing station
and drink a bottle of stout with Troitski, which he
had managed to get by secret means from some
treasured spot. Though many envied him his privileged
position, no one could ever find out whence
he got his stout.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>In order to strengthen the positions, we had to
construct, in addition to the trenches, various kinds
of obstacles at the most important points.</p>

<p>The favourite device, and the most effective one,
was the wire entanglement, but there was very little
barbed wire in the fortress.</p>

<p>Certainly, an enormous quantity of barbed wire
had necessarily been used for strengthening the main
inner defensive line, but when it came to blocking
the intervals between the forts (before our arrival
in Port Arthur) no one seemed to have thought of
fortifying 174 Metre Hill. I do not say this in any
spirit of criticism of those who fortified Port Arthur.
Naturally they had to strengthen the main line of
defence first, and they had not sufficient material
for 174 Metre Hill as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The following were covered by wire entanglements:
203 Metre Hill, the left flank of Akasaka Yama (a
very short piece), the left flank of Division Hill, and
the right flank of Namako Yama. (The space between
Extinct Volcano and Namako Yama was
strengthened by planks with spikes in them.<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>) To
prevent the enemy breaking through between Falshivy
Hill<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and 203 Metre Hill, fougasses were laid,
as also between Akasaka Yama and Namako Yama,
and on the left flank of Division Hill. These fougasses
were much dreaded by the Japanese, and for
that reason, perhaps, they did not once attempt to
force any of the valleys, but always elected to climb
up the most impossible cliffs.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>We had suffered many defeats from August 14,
and continued to do so until September, the Japanese,
thanks to their superiority in artillery, taking hill
after hill from us.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I did not despair, and often consoled
General Kondratenko, pointing out to him that the
nearer we drew towards our main defensive line, the
more effective would become our defence, by reason
of the greater facility of communication between the
defenders of the various positions.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the centre,<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> where the main Japanese
attacks were directed, we successfully defended
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>ourselves, and our successes there raised our spirits
considerably.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>There were no sheep left. We had eaten them all.
We had lamb occasionally for dinner, cut up into
very small portions and served as tit-bits, but we
lived mainly on rice soup.</p>

<p>It was always very hard to get hay for the horses,
and very soon it would become impossible to buy
any, and we should have to indent for it. The
Government forage stores had not yet been
touched.</p>

<p>We sent Lieutenant Bogdanovitch to Pigeon Bay
to get us some fish. He brought back a good many,
but all were rockfish, which none of us would have
looked at a few months before.</p>

<p>As I have already said, on the capture of 174 Metre
Hill, we evacuated Connecting Ridge, which the
Japanese immediately occupied and began to fortify.
They also constructed a strong line of trenches designed
to sweep the rear of Namako Yama.</p>

<p>On August 15, I was placed in command of the
forts and batteries in the defensive line from Fort
Yi-tzu Shan to Fort Ta-yang-kou North.</p>

<p>I had constantly been on all these positions and
forts. Fort Ta-an-tzu Shan was the only one completed,
while Fort Yi-tzu Shan was finished in the
interior, but there were no traverses, and the garrison
had to construct some with the help of sand-bags.
There were also no caponiers in the ditches, and one
could come out on to the gorge<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> from the ditch
on the left flank and climb up on to the parapet.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>Therefore the men composing the garrison themselves
made an open caponier at the front corner
(chief salient), blocking the approach to it by iron
gratings.</p>

<p>Fort Ta-yang-kou North was worked by the
garrison throughout the siege. All that the enemy
could see was a gigantic pile of hewn stone, in front
of which was a ditch about 4 sagenes<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> deep,
with vertical escarp and counterscarp cut out
of the rock. A bare slope ran down into this
ditch from the entrance of the fort. It was
intended to have made a gate, but, as there was
not time to cut it out, any one was free to come
up out of the deep ditch on to this slope, and so,
from both sides of the ditch, straight up through the
entrance of the fort. Casemates or splinter-proofs
were entirely wanting. There was also no defence
on the right flank, so that the interior of the fort
was plainly visible from the enemy’s artillery
positions. The front face and entrance were splendidly
flanked, but the left flank was taken completely
in reverse by very many Japanese batteries.</p>

<p>With the assistance of some workmen sent up
by us the garrison strengthened the right flank with
blindages. In the centre of, and behind, the entrance
a strong bomb-proof was built, sufficiently
large to accommodate the entire garrison. The roof
of this bomb-proof was specially made to withstand
shells of large calibre (I myself saw the damage caused
by an 11-inch shell on the right front of a corner
of it, but the bomb-proof itself was not touched).
Splinter-proofs for officers and gun detachments were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>built under the ramparts, and near the right flank
a large search-light, with a big steam engine, was
placed without any cover whatever.</p>

<p>The space between Forts Yi-tzu Shan and Ta-yang-kou
North was covered by an unbroken line of
wire entanglements, supplemented by a large number
of fougasses, and above them again a line of trenches,
which were, however, very shallow and had very thin
parapets. We were only able to complete them after
our retreat from 174 Metre Hill to our main positions.</p>

<p>Threatened from the side of Extinct Volcano, and
enfiladed from Connecting Ridge, Namako Yama was
in a dangerous position, the more so, as the trenches
on it were absolutely devoid of overhead cover from
shrapnel fire. It was a good thing that after the
capture of 174 Metre Hill we had constructed long
traverses the whole breadth of the hill, so that
the enfilade fire from Connecting Ridge had little
effect. When the rear of Namako Yama began to
suffer from the firing from Connecting Ridge, I
posted two quick-firing guns near the road leading
up the hill. They demolished the trenches on
Connecting Ridge and caused the Japanese to stop
their annoying and dangerous fusillade. In order
to ensure Namako Yama against night attacks, I
blocked the road running along its rear with a row
of fougasses, wire entanglements, and <i>chevaux de
frise</i> made out of planks (an excellent obstacle when
there is no artillery to demolish it). To prevent
a turning movement on the right flank, I laid fougasses
there, and extended the trenches on the right
flank of Akasaka Yama, where I posted two companies
in well-constructed trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of all these measures Namako Yama was
very weak, as the trenches were very shallow and
unprotected by head cover from shrapnel. Besides
that drawback the near slopes of the hill could not
everywhere be swept by the fire of the defenders, a
serious failing when one had to deal with an enemy
such as the Japanese. All this showed me that
Namako Yama was in a very precarious state,
although defended by six companies.</p>

<p>Taking everything into account, I set to work to
strengthen the defences on Akasaka Yama, but want
of tools and men delayed the work, more especially
so as we had at the same time to strengthen the left
flank of Division Hill, which was sadly in need of
it. It was possible to see, not only the heads, but
even the heels of the riflemen defending the trenches
from the direction of Extinct Volcano. It was also
impossible for us to reach the hill, so we had to
dig at least two long communication trenches. All
this required an enormous number of tools and men,
and the difficulty of making fortifications was increased
by the scarcity of everything needed.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that we had an abundance of
rain, yielding streams full of clean, cold, fresh water,
and providing bathing and washing places for nearly
every company on the position.</p>

<p>203 Metre Hill and Namako Yama were worse
off in this respect. The men had to go from there
to the artillery horse-ponds near the headquarters
of the staff, not accessible without some danger.
Second-Lieutenant Ivanov was wounded in the leg
there by a stray bullet. There was, however, no
other less exposed place available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>On August 22 and 23 the Japanese main assault<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
on the centre of our defensive line was beaten back,
the enemy losing very heavily. We were told that
all the slopes of the hills attacked were piled up with
Japanese bodies, and that the stench was becoming
unbearable, from which cause we also suffered, owing
to the number of dead on Extinct Volcano.</p>

<p>When Major Zimmermann was wounded on August
22, I appointed Major Moskvin, who had been
in charge of administration, to command on Namako
Yama. I had great faith in this gallant, energetic
officer, and felt assured that the defence of Namako
Yama would be safer in his hands than in those of
any other man, all our own officers being utterly worn
out and requiring immediate rest. Apart from that
consideration, they were nearly all wounded.</p>

<p>About this time the following occurrence took place.
Lieutenant Frost, our paymaster, Captain Felitzin,
and Father Vasili Slounin were put up in my former
quarters near the bazaar in the New Town. In
the morning (I do not remember at what time)
they had only just got up and were drinking tea,
when a shell burst in the room in which they
were sitting. Captain Felitzin was wounded in the
head, as was also Father Slounin (he had some of his
hair singed off), and Lieutenant Frost was severely
wounded in the head, besides receiving several other
minor wounds in the face. Thank God! none of
them were killed, and all were soon quite well again.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Very many of our horses were killed in our two-wheeled
carts and company wagons while taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
supplies up to the positions. The horses killed
were eaten, thus helping to keep up the physical
strength of the rank and file. Many of them did
not fancy horse-flesh, but, following the example of
others, they ate it, and felt all the better for it. The
following incident will serve to prove that horse-flesh
was eventually much sought after. I do not remember
exactly when it was, but a horse was killed
on one occasion near our staff headquarters. That
day, for want of men, we did not remove the carcass,
and in the morning the horse had gone, a few bloodstains
only showing where it had lain. We learnt afterwards
that the men on Red Hill had come over, cut it
up into chunks, and divided it amongst themselves.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>I got up very early on August 24, drank a cup of
tea, and, seeing that all was quiet, went to take my
constitutional in the wood on Red Hill. It was a
glorious morning, and I could plainly see the men on
the positions going down to wash.</p>

<p>The smoke of the field kitchens rose up into the
clear air; it promised to be a magnificent day.</p>

<p>I cannot remember how long I sat there amongst
the fragrant green trees, but I should have stayed
some considerable time if I had not been hailed from
below. Some one called to me to go with Colonel
Irman to Fort Ta-yang-kou North, upon which I
quickly descended the hill, found my horse already
saddled, and in a few minutes we had reached the
fort mentioned by the town road. It would not
have been safe to have gone straight across.</p>

<p>About half-way we passed a battery of 42-mm.
guns (No. 4 Redoubt).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>I pointed out to the commander of this battery
the end of a Japanese trench, where our scouts said
there were some Japanese machine guns which interfered
with our sorties. The embrasures for these
guns were plainly visible through glasses.</p>

<p>Our guns were quickly laid on the target, and after
a few ranging shots the shells began to fall with
extraordinary accuracy.</p>

<p>The dangerous end of the trench was destroyed, but
I think the guns remained untouched, perhaps because
the Japanese, anticipating the impending bombardment,
had removed them to another spot. It would,
however, give them a whole night’s work to put
them into position again. The 42-mm. gun is a very
accurate weapon, and it is a pity that the effect
of its high-explosive shell is so slight as to render it
good only for dismounting the enemy’s pieces. The
gun is sufficiently mobile to be capable of quick and
sudden concentration on any fully exposed hostile
battery, a contingency which would, however, rarely
occur, as nowadays all batteries are carefully hidden
from the enemy’s view. Pieces, however, of this type
are incapable of coping with heavy guns, and one
would not advocate having many of them in a fortress.
Their real place is in reserve, and not in batteries on
the main fighting positions.</p>

<p>The enemy did not fire a single shot in reply to the
42-mm. guns and we quietly rode on to Fort Ta-yang-kou
North, which we reached a few minutes
later.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet at the fort. The men worked
steadily and without hindrance, but there was an
enormous amount to be done, the task undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
by the garrison being to construct a covered trench
as well as some splinter-proofs. Splinter-proofs for
the gun detachments and officers had already been
constructed, so the fort became more or less self-contained
and able to put up a good defence.</p>

<p>Our riflemen had originally been posted outside the
fort, but, with the completion of a large bomb-proof
and covered way with traverses inside, it was possible
for them to occupy the real defensive line and live
in the fort. As always, the officers received us
gladly, gave us tea, and then took us on a tour of
inspection. Every one was at his post. The work
was going on apace, and Captain Versi, of the Naval
Construction Department, who was superintending
the work on the fort, displayed great energy and
resource. The exits from the ditch were covered,
and the flank ditches well enfiladed from both
sides.</p>

<p>A large bomb-proof, impervious alike to rifle and
shell fire, was being constructed for the reserve, but
the ground was solid rock, and so the work was slow.
We had finished our inspection and were talking to
the commandant in a splinter-proof, when we heard a
loud crash, caused by the bursting of a large Japanese
shell somewhere near.</p>

<p>We all followed Colonel Irman out of the shelter.
The gun detachments were working at their guns,
laying them on some far-distant point from which
the enemy’s shell had come. It was dangerous to
stand in the open, so with Colonel Irman I ran to
the nearest gun, where the signaller could always
give warning of the coming of a shell. Ere the guns
had been correctly laid, the signaller shouted: “Look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
out!” I ran quickly down into a traverse with some
sailors. The enemy’s shell screamed over our heads,
and burst with a tremendous report on the traverse
of No. 2 gun. In the twinkling of an eye, the sailors
were at their places and the two 6-inch Canet guns<a id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
roared forth. I jumped up to see where our shells
fell, and clearly saw two puffs of smoke on a very
far-distant hill, right behind the Japanese positions.
“Do you mean to say there is anything there?” I
said to the gun captain of No. 1 gun. “Yes, sir, it is
there all right, we noticed it a long time ago.” Again
the signaller shouted: “Look out!” and we again
rushed under cover while the shell shrieked over us,
but this time it went a long way over and burst somewhere
behind the fort. Almost before it had struck,
the sailors were at their guns and two more
shells were sent towards the same spot, and then
other forts joined in adding to the death and
destruction.</p>

<p>This artillery duel continued for a long time. We
alternately came out to observe and ran back under
cover. Colonel Irman was much more indifferent to
danger than I was. It seemed to me that my position
behind the traverse was not a particularly safe one,
and I decided to change it for a bomb-proof. At
the next shout of “Look out!” I put my idea into
execution, but with unfortunate results. A number
of men rushed with me towards the point of safety,
we tumbled one on top of the other, and I found
myself among those who had not time to get into the
bomb-proof before the enemy’s shell fell behind us,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>burst with a deafening report, and buried us in
smoke, stones, and dust.</p>

<p>Luckily, none of us were badly hurt, but I had a
large bruise on my back to carry away with me as a
memento of the occasion.</p>

<p>We had paid no attention to the other hills
during this bombardment, but now we saw that the
Japanese were evidently preparing for something
very important.</p>

<p>When peace reigned again on Fort Ta-yang-kou
North, we noticed that 203 Metre Hill was wreathed
in smoke from bursting shell. Apparently, instead of
the usual daily allowance of two or three dozen shell,
the Japanese had already expended more than a
hundred rounds on it. This caused us much anxiety,
and we galloped off as hard as we could go to the
position of the staff. When we arrived, we received
a message from 203 Metre Hill from Major Stempnevski
to the effect that the enemy was sweeping the
hill with artillery, and that the left flank of our
trenches had suffered severely from shell fire.</p>

<p>Namako Yama was also being heavily bombarded,
and it was evident that an assault was imminent.
It would be difficult to hold this hill, as it was swept
from front to rear and from flank to flank. We
could hear very heavy firing from the north-eastern
section too, where the situation was evidently even
more serious than with us. Namako Yama was
fairly strongly held by six companies.<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> On the right
flank were two 6-inch guns and one quick-firing gun,
with Lieutenant Kolmakov in command. On 203
Metre Hill there were only two companies, the 2nd
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>and 4th of the 5th Regiment, and two quick-firing
guns (I do not count the two short 6-inch guns, as
they had been silenced long before). Fearing for the
safety of 203 Metre Hill, I sent another company
there from the reserve.</p>

<p>Compared with other points, the position of the
defenders there was serious. Food could only be
taken up to them at night, and there being no water
at all on the hill, that had to be carried up at night
also. It was impossible for any one to show himself
on the skyline. As the enemy was within a stone’s-throw
of the defenders, eight patrols of six men each
had to be furnished at night. There were no junior
officers in the companies, and gun ammunition was
very scarce.</p>

<p>Foreseeing the capture of 174 Metre Hill, we had
actually begun to fortify Namako Yama on August 11.
The work itself was very heavy, besides which the
rocky nature of the soil and the want of tools hampered
us greatly. A battery for two long 6-inch
guns had been previously constructed on the hill and
a road made leading up to it. The men only worked
at night, as it would have been madness to do so in
the daytime in face of the enemy’s heavy fire. It
was even dangerous to move about, and every day
we had several men killed there. The total number
of defenders amounted to about 500 men. By
day one section out of each company was in the
trenches and furnished sentries for observation purposes,
while three sections slept behind the slope of
the road, which ran the whole length of the hill,
where small splinter-proofs had been made out of
planks. After dinner at night the garrison of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
post started work, covering itself with a line of
outposts.</p>

<p>On the night of August 25–26 I was awakened by
heavy rifle firing in the direction of Division Hill.
Soon an orderly galloped up with the report that the
Japanese were climbing up Namako Yama. I threw
on my clothes and galloped off towards Namako
Yama, ordering two reserve companies, posted near
the regimental staff quarters, to proceed there immediately.</p>

<p>Having reached a spur of Akasaka Yama, I began
to watch the battle. The weather was as bad as
it could be, a strong wind was blowing, and it
was raining as well. I felt quite confident, knowing
that if the enemy had not succeeded in coming up
unobserved and taking our men by surprise, he would
certainly be beaten back.</p>

<p>At this time our batteries opened fire, at Colonel
Irman’s orders, on the valley in front of Namako
Yama, and the whole foreground was lit up by our
star-rockets. In another half-hour our reserve companies
came up, and Colonel Irman also arrived.</p>

<p>Several wounded men who were being carried back
from the hill told us that the Japanese had not
climbed up any farther, but were firing from below,
which meant they had been driven off.</p>

<p>In half an hour the firing ceased, and Major Moskvin
reported that the assault had been beaten back with
heavy losses to the enemy, who tried to take us by
surprise, but was discovered in good time by the
standing sentries, whose warnings had given our men
time to get to their posts.</p>

<p>We had 4 men killed and 16 wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>After this attack we made a communication trench
from the road above along the hill to the advanced
trenches, because all our casualties had occurred as
our men were running to occupy their trenches.</p>

<p>On the night of September 1–2 the Japanese again
tried to take Namako Yama by surprise, but were
driven off by rifle fire and retreated behind 174 Metre
Hill after suffering heavily. We had Lieutenant
Afanaisev and 6 sailors wounded.</p>

<p>For the repulse of these two night attacks, Major
Moskvin received the thanks of the General Officer
Commanding, in General Orders, and he and a number
of other officers were recommended for rewards, but
they never got them, owing to the list of rewards
recommended being lost.</p>

<p>After these attacks Colonel Irman and I proceeded
to Namako Yama on a visit of inspection, as the
Japanese had evidently chosen it as their point of
attack.</p>

<p>This inspection left me with a very bad impression.
The trenches were still very shallow, of overhead
cover there was practically none, and the enemy had
posted some batteries behind 174 Metre Hill and on
the slopes of the hills in front of it at a very short
range from us; but our men were in splendid spirits,
in spite of the constant heavy fire.</p>

<p>On September 8 the company of Marines on the
right flank was relieved by No. 7 Company of the
28th Regiment. This company had not shown up
very well during the fighting on 174 Metre Hill, but
I had no other unit to send up, and I thought that
it would be anxious to redeem its reputation.</p>

<p>From September 8 to 17, things were fairly quiet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
on Namako Yama, but at the dinner hour, about
twelve o’clock, on the 17th, the Japanese (about
one company) made a rush from Extinct Volcano
against the right flank of Namako Yama, and captured
the trench occupied by the 7th Company of the
28th Regiment without firing a shot. The men of
the company were having their dinners at the moment,
and had not time to seize their arms before
the Japanese were in the trench. Hearing of this
by telephone from Division Hill, I immediately
telephoned an order that the Japanese were to be
driven out of the trench, and received an answer to
the effect that Major Moskvin had ordered the 7th
Company to reoccupy their trench without delay.
This company, however, proved unequal to the task.</p>

<p>An attack by the 1st Company of Marines was
also not wholly successful, as, though a part of the
right flank of the trench was retaken, the Japanese
held the other end, and blocked it with rocks and
sand-bags.</p>

<p>Alarmed at such a state of affairs, I went with
Colonel Irman to the hill. I personally inspected
the place where the Japanese were lodged. They did
not show themselves at all, and there was not a sign
of life anywhere. They had built up a strong barricade,
so high that a man could not climb up it without
the help of another.</p>

<p>We could easily have dislodged them with hand
grenades, but we had none. It was absolutely essential
that we should drive them out, and as it seemed
to me that it could best be done at night, I gave
orders to that effect accordingly. For some reason,
however, the attack did not come off, the commandant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
contenting himself with fortifying a small knoll on
the right flank of the Japanese.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 18 the enemy
opened such a terrific fire on the hill with rifles and
five guns that came into action at a very short range,
that all our trenches were knocked to pieces, and we
suffered heavy losses.</p>

<p>On this day that splendid officer, Captain Saltovski,
commanding the 9th Company, was killed, and the
company itself lost 26 killed and 49 wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy attacked the hill during the day and
captured the advanced trenches of our 9th Company,
but the gallant fellows, quite unaided, reassembled
on the crest-line, charged with the bayonet, and
recaptured their ruined trenches. The hill was in
a hopeless plight. Surrounded on all sides, it was
an impossible position.</p>

<p>Colonel Irman and I sent a report to this effect
to General Kondratenko, and then rode off to Akasaka
Yama to observe and discuss the chances of
holding the hill if it continued to be deluged with
such a fearful fire from all sides.</p>

<p>Apparently there were sufficient men to defend
the hill. To send up reinforcements only meant
subjecting them to the enemy’s deadly fire, as all
cover had been demolished, and, moreover, the commandant
did not ask for help, although expecting an
attack every moment.</p>

<p>The Japanese concentrated under the hill in considerable
numbers, concealing themselves very cleverly
in the folds of the ground. However, we moved the
reserve nearer the hill, but kept the 10th Company,
which was placed on the right flank of Akasaka<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Yama, in its former position. Thus the whole day
passed. Our 9th Company fought minus officers.
The <i>moral</i> of the troops under this deadly fire was
extraordinary. Towards evening the firing died
down, dinners were sent up to the men, and one
company (the 12th of the 13th Regiment, I think)
was sent as a reinforcement to help to hold the place
during the night.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of September 19 Colonel
Irman and I proceeded to our observation station.
Firing had already commenced, especially against
203 Metre Hill and Namako Yama. We received a
report that the Japanese were moving in force against
these hills, so we expected an attack on both of them
simultaneously. I therefore moved my reserves to
the hollow behind Akasaka Yama, so that they should
be under my hand and easily despatched to either
203 Metre Hill or Namako Yama. The situation
was unchanged, but our men were suffering severely
from the artillery fire. Hence we came to the conclusion
that the Japanese intended to leave things
as they were, and compel us to evacuate the hill
without making an attack.</p>

<p>Towards evening Colonel Irman and I became
convinced that the Japanese did not intend to attack,
as I had received no reports to the contrary from the
hills. The only report sent in by Major Moskvin
was to the effect that he was organizing an attack
on the trenches occupied by the Japanese, and that,
by enfilade fire from the left of the hill, he had annihilated
1,000 Japanese who had been lying down
under 203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>I was delighted at this success. About 6 p.m.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Captain Sirotko, of the Frontier Guard, who was
attached to my regiment, joined me on Akasaka
Yama. I immediately sent him to command our
9th Company on Namako Yama. In the evening
the firing again slackened, dinners were sent up,
and a reinforcement of one company of the Reserve
Battalion detailed for assisting in the night’s work.
That night I inspected the works on 203 Metre Hill
and Namako Yama. Those on the former were
practically undamaged, but on the latter all were
destroyed. I spent the night with my orderlies in
a ravine behind the 10th Company, in the dug-out
of the officer commanding the 10th Company, and
slept for three hours.</p>

</div>

<p class="hang small">Continuation of the struggle for Namako Yama, and abandonment
of the hill, September 20—The first attacks on 203 Metre Hill,
September 19–22.</p>

<p class="noindent">On the morning of September 20 the cannonade
commenced very early, reaching its zenith at about
midday. Our men kept low in their trenches during
this veritable hell of fire, which continued for about
two hours. “Will they hold on, or not?” I thought
to myself, looking towards the right flank of Namako
Yama, which was being subjected to the full fury
of the bombardment. Our gunners failed to locate
the enemy’s batteries, and thus remained impotent
witnesses of the slaughter of our companies.</p>

<p>Just then I saw the top of the right flank of Namako
Yama covered with grey smoke and the men there
rushing headlong down the hill. The Japanese were
using hand grenades charged with pyroxylin and
Melinite, this being the first instance of their use.
I immediately sent a report of what was happening.
After the men on the right flank (they were the
7th Company of the 28th Regiment) had run, the
others from the battery and the enemy appeared
simultaneously on the crest. A few minutes later,
from the left of the battery behind the crest of the
hill, appeared a group of our men, who opened fire
on the Japanese and drove them off the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, our men did not remain where
they were, but also ran back down the hill. Colonel
Irman came up just in time to witness the complete
evacuation of the position. It all happened in a
very few minutes. We immediately sent all the
officers and orderlies near us with orders to the retreating
companies to stop on Akasaka Yama and
occupy the trenches there, and I also moved the
whole of my reserve there.</p>

<p>Our artillery was evidently watching the course
of the fight on Namako Yama, for, as soon as we
had evacuated it, our shells fell like hail on the
summit, and the Japanese disappeared like smoke
before the wind. This enabled us to occupy Akasaka
Yama at our ease, and in the night we fortified
ourselves strongly.</p>

<p>I think it would be interesting to describe the
action of our 9th Company during the last minutes
of the defence of Namako Yama.</p>

<p>When Captain Sirotko arrived, he found the company
in a critical position. Acting Ensign Anikin
of the 27th Regiment was in command. The trenches
were in ruins and enfiladed from two sides by rifle
fire, and from 174 Metre Hill by gun fire as well.
Piles of dead bodies were heaped up all round, blocking
the trenches at various points.</p>

<p>The right flank of the company’s trench was connected
with that of the 7th Company of the 28th
Regiment, of which the enemy now held possession,<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and from which was enfiladed the trench
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>of the 9th Company. Lower down, behind the rocks
in front of the trench, was another small party of
Japanese.</p>

<p>Wishing to find out in what strength the enemy
held the 7th Company’s trench, Captain Sirotko
called for volunteers to attack them. Twelve men
came forward and made a rush, but they were met
by a volley from about 100 Japanese, losing five men,
whereupon they retired. Having reported this to
Major Moskvin, Captain Sirotko received an order
that the 7th Company of the 28th Regiment and one
company of Marines were to attack and drive the
enemy out of the trench.</p>

<p>About 8 a.m. three Japanese batteries of heavy
guns, posted in a valley behind 174 Metre Hill, four
quick-firing guns from 174 Metre Hill itself, and five
or seven heavy guns that came into action on Connecting
Ridge, near the Chinese temple, all of them
concealed from our batteries, opened fire with high-explosive
shell and shrapnel.</p>

<p>By about 2 p.m. only 48 men were left out of the
original 155 in the 9th Company; many of them
were wounded, and nearly all more or less injured by
stones and clods of earth. The trench was quite
full of the bodies of the fallen.</p>

<p>Captain Sirotko asked that an emplacement to
his left might be occupied, so Major Moskvin sent
50 men of the Reserve Battalion for that purpose.
These, however, occupied a communication trench
near that of the 9th Company instead of the position
assigned to them, and subsequently ran off precipitately
the moment a few shells fell near them. Just
then the gun fire slackened, but firing continued on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the right flank, and strong columns were seen advancing
from Extinct Volcano, one of which began
to turn No. 9 Company’s right flank.</p>

<p>Captain Sirotko could not see a single man in the
upper tier of trenches above him—they had all retreated.
Then he ordered the remnants of the
company, and also Melinkov with his 30 Marines,
to abandon the trenches. At this time there was
not a single non-commissioned officer on Namako
Yama, except those left in the splinter-proofs. In
the trenches of the 12th Company of the 13th Regiment
there remained only a sentry and one non-commissioned
officer, who had been forgotten by
their company and did not know that their comrades
had retreated. Akasaka Yama was alive with retreating
men. Captain Sirotko, with the remainder
of his company, opened fire on the Japanese who
showed on the crest of the hill, compelling them to
take cover, and thus giving all those left alive time
to retreat quietly on to Akasaka Yama.</p>

<p class="noindent center p2"><span class="smcap bold">The First Attack on 203 Metre Hill</span></p>

<p>The Japanese commenced their bombardment of
203 Metre Hill and Namako Yama simultaneously.
I thought that they were going to attack Namako
Yama first, but was mistaken. I must mention in
this connection that the fortifications on 203 Metre
Hill were now so strong as to be practically impervious
to 6-inch shells, and a heavy bombardment with
projectiles of that type would make but slow progress.
From this it was inferred that an assault
on 203 Metre Hill would have to be somewhat later
than the one on Namako Yama, which was defended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
by but weak entrenchments. It would not be worth
while, we thought, for the enemy to indulge
merely in “sweeping” fire.<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

    <p class="x-small right">[p. 175</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>About 3 p.m. on September 5 a Japanese battery
had opened fire on 203 Metre Hill, and on the 6th it
was observed that the enemy had during the preceding
night placed two guns in a covered position
behind 174 Metre Hill, with which he began to
sweep the rifle pits on 203 Metre Hill (see <a href="#image_Page_175">Plate I.</a>).
From the 7th onwards it was noticed that the enemy
was massing troops behind Siedlovy (Saddle)<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and
174 Metre Hills, until he had there, by September 14,
about one brigade of infantry, with a squadron of
cavalry; and from this date the enemy began to
fortify himself strongly on Connecting Ridge and
its offshoots.</p>

<p>At daybreak on September 19 two companies
attacked<a id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> our outposts on the spurs of 203 Metre
Hill, captured their positions, and began to dig
themselves in. Our artillery and rifle fire several
times put a stop to their work, compelling them to
take cover, but they nevertheless finally made good
their hold on the trenches and began to pour in a hot
rifle and gun fire on 203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>From all this it could reasonably be concluded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>that they had decided to make an attack. When,
therefore, Major Stempnevski (sen.), the commandant
of the hill, asked for reinforcements, I sent him the
1st Company of the 28th Regiment, under Second-Lieutenant
Protasevitch, who reached the hill at
6 p.m., the 11th Company of the 27th Regiment,
under Captain Churbanov, and the 7th Company of
the 27th Regiment, under Major Jeltkevitch, both
of whom arrived at 8 p.m. Altogether there were
on the hill on September 19, 480 bayonets, 50
gunners, 2 miners, 6 telephonists, and 6 Marines.<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Of guns, there were the following: two 6-inch,
two heavy battery, and two quick-firing guns on the
col between 203 Metre Hill and Akasaka Yama,
also two 37-mm. guns, four machine guns, and one
mortar for throwing pyroxylin bombs.</p>

<p>About 5 p.m. on the 19th the mortar was dismounted
by a shell, and one 6-inch, one heavy, and
two machine guns were disabled.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the companies the commandant
disposed them as follows: the 1st Company of the
28th Regiment, and half the 11th Company of the
27th Regiment in the trenches on the right flank,
the remainder in the reserve.</p>

<p>At 8.30 p.m., as the enemy was seen advancing
on the left flank, the commandant sent half the 11th
Company, 27th Regiment to occupy the stone-hewn
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>trenches on the very top of the hill, so that it
could pick off the Japanese as they climbed up on
to the roofs of the bomb-proofs along the main
trenches.</p>

<p>At that time there were no redoubts on the top
of 203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>The 7th Company, 27th Regiment was placed in
reserve behind the 11th half-company.</p>

<p>The enemy did not for a second cease his rifle and
machine-gun fire from Saddle Hill. He commenced
his attacks at 10 p.m., advancing always in dense
columns. Though our riflemen and gunners from
the neighbouring batteries and trenches caused
fearful havoc among the attackers, the Japanese
nevertheless reached the wire entanglement and cut
it in two places; however, they could not get any
farther, as our volleys swept them away by the
hundred. Our 8th Company, which was occupying
False Hill, and was thus acting on the enemy’s
flank, rendered great service in destroying the enemy.
A few Japanese, however, succeeded in reaching our
trenches, but, when there, were killed by hand grenades.
Throughout the night the enemy’s infantry
continued their attack, supported by fire from every
kind of gun, but at about 9 a.m. they retired into
the ravines and valleys behind Connecting Ridge.
In these attacks the Japanese lost more than 1,500
men in killed alone.</p>

<p>At 7 a.m. on the 20th the enemy’s artillery
swept the hill with fire, but about 10 a.m.
changed its objective to Namako Yama, which was
finally captured at 2 p.m., as already described.
At 4 p.m. fire was again directed on 203 Metre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Hill, and the enemy’s infantry began to concentrate
behind Connecting Ridge.</p>

<p>The troops in question were collected in order to
relieve those that had attacked the hill on the 7th.
That night they made several attacks, one after the
other, but each time were beaten back with heavy
losses. We were greatly indebted to our star-rockets
for the repulse of all these night attacks. However,
a section of Japanese fought its way into our
trenches, and occupied one large bomb-proof and
one small one where we had a Maxim.<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The news of this reached me at daybreak on the
21st, on Akasaka Yama, where work was proceeding
on the trenches, and whence I watched the fighting<a id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
on 203 Metre Hill. This intelligence was so alarming
that I returned to the staff headquarters, where I
found Colonel Irman, who, at Major Stempnevski’s
request, sent up one company from the reserve (our
6th Company).</p>

<p>Reinforced by this company, the garrison of the
hill made a counter-attack and retook a large portion
of the half-ruined trench previously seized by the
Japanese. A small body of the latter, however, still
held the two bomb-proofs, and could not be turned
out, and thus the part of the trench between these
two bomb-proofs also remained in their hands. Unfortunately,
this was the identical piece of trench
in front of which was “dead ground” to all our
batteries. The enemy could consequently pass
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>freely and in safety to and from their comrades
lodged in our trench. This was no novel experience
for us, but I well knew the danger of it.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the Japanese from spreading
along the trench, our 6th Company was ordered to
occupy both ends of it. Our assailants tried several
times to climb right up to the top of the hill, but were
driven back on each occasion. Finally, the commandant
sent a portion of the 6th Company there, and
the gallant fellows, standing out in the open all day
under shrapnel fire, prevented the enemy from reaching
the summit of the hill. All this was plainly
visible to the staff, who were tremendously impressed
by our men’s splendid behaviour.</p>

<p>That evening, at my orders, the top of the hill was
surrounded with a ring of small trenches, and during
the night these trenches were connected up with the
batteries on the right flank of the hill, which measure
rendered our position fairly safe.</p>

<p>Several desperate attacks were successfully repulsed,
in spite of the fact that the first of them was
made before the completion of the trenches, when our
men had to stand up in them without any cover
under a perfect storm of shells. They <i>had</i> to stand
up, as they could not fire down the steep slope of
the hill in a sitting position. The situation was
critical. We were losing men so fast under the terrific
fire that the companies were literally melting away
minute by minute. An endless stream of wounded
continued to be carried away from the hill all through
the night. In view of this, Colonel Irman sent for
reinforcements from the general reserve, all our
local reserves having been used up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Danger threatened 203 Metre Hill’s other neighbours,
especially the left flank of Akasaka Yama,
where there was some dead ground right up under
the trenches.</p>

<p>My own personal observations from early morning
on September 20, from Akasaka Yama, were as
follows: everything was quiet on the rear side of
203 Metre Hill, in spite of the shells bursting over it,
as if the garrison were in no danger whatever. The
companies were standing quietly in the trenches,
visible to us. The trenches themselves were, apparently,
very little damaged. Thank God! only a
few shells had pierced the roofs of the bomb-proofs.
Only one bomb-proof on the right flank of the hill,
facing 174 Metre Hill, was seriously damaged. There
was not a single Japanese to be seen anywhere.
They are indeed a wonderful people! But the rattle
of musketry did not cease for a second. The enemy
was firing from the trenches surrounding the hill,
chiefly from Saddle Hill. The dull reports of bursting
shell did little more than deafen the men in the bomb-proofs.
A veritable blizzard of lead swept the rear
of the hill and the road leading along the top, and
huddled up beneath the steep embankment of the
latter sat some of the reserves.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Judging by present appearances, it seemed as
though we were not in such a very bad way, though
the part of our trenches occupied by the Japanese
was a thorn in my side. I knew from experience
that this foreboded the final capture of the hill, and
incidentally the destruction of our fleet. Colonel
Irman, I believe, watched 203 Metre Hill from the
side of False Hill. No living man was visible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
from that side, but from both Akasaka Yama
and False Hill the Japanese dead were to be seen
in piles. In the ravine at the foot of 203 Metre Hill
there were hundreds, if not thousands, of them.</p>

<p>After half an hour’s observation I returned to
the staff. Everything was as quiet there as if the
fortress was not threatened with any danger. But
dark clouds were gathering.</p>

<p>A report came in from Division Hill that large
bodies of Japanese infantry were moving towards
174 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>It became imperative to drive the enemy out
of our trench on 203 Metre Hill. An idea occurred to
me to roll a large naval mine down on the occupants,
as some of the other forts had done. General Kondratenko
and Colonel Irman approving of my scheme,
I at once sent for Lieutenant Podgourski, who was
a specialist in these matters. This was late in
the evening, so he promised to come in the morning
with some mines. Having little hope of success
with the large mines, I asked him to bring, in addition,
small ones (from 6 to 10-lb. bombs), and we decided
to attack the Japanese in the bomb-proofs with
these missiles.</p>

<p>Our losses during these two days (<i>i.e.</i> September
19 and 20) were as follows: In the 2nd Company,
out of 141 men there were left, including slightly
wounded, 83; in the 4th Company, 48 out of 167;
in the 11th Company of the 27th Regiment, 96 out
of 140; and of No. 7 Company of the 27th Regiment,
and No. 1 Company of the 28th Regiment half their
strength was <i>hors de combat</i>. During this time
also the following officers were killed: Major Jeltkevitch,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
commanding the 7th Company of the 27th
Regiment, and Ensign Diantrougov, the junior
officer of the 1st Company, 28th Regiment.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate idea of Father Slounin to
bury the dead near the road leading from 203
Metre Hill to the staff headquarters. The sight
of our dead heroes, lying in long rows along that
road, was bound to leave a bad impression on those
who passed by.</p>

<p>As evening drew to a close, taking advantage of a temporary
lull, I sent another company from the reserve
with tools and sand-bags to work on 203 Metre
Hill; it was absolutely imperative to strengthen our
trenches on the top of the hill by means of sand-bags.
This company, being our last reserve, was to return
in the morning. As far as I remember, it was on this
night that two companies of the 27th Regiment
arrived which we had asked of General Kondratenko
for strengthening the works on Akasaka Yama.
They were sent there forthwith, and remained until
the end of the siege.</p>

<p>I was deadbeat that day, and when I got the chance,
I threw myself down and snatched a few minutes’
sleep. In consequence of the wide extent of ground
covered by our command, both Colonel Irman and
myself were utterly worn out.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 21 the enemy’s
fire against 203 Metre Hill increased in volume.
We had a splendid view of the hill from the trenches
near the quarters of the staff. As I was watching,
I plainly saw a Japanese flag waving over the bomb-proof
on the left. I ran to the telephone and asked
what was the meaning of it, to which the commandant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
answered that he knew nothing about the flag, and
that everything was all right on the hill. The Japanese
were sitting quietly in their trenches. I gave
orders for the flag to be taken down, and was glad
to see that it had disappeared a few minutes afterwards.
Some Japanese soldier had crawled up
during the night and stuck it into the roof; but how
he did it, no one knew. That morning 203 Metre
Hill and the part of Akasaka Yama lying nearest
to it were subjected to a tremendous fire from the
Japanese heavy artillery, and we expected an assault
every moment; the more so, as we noticed that
the enemy had concentrated a very large force right
under 203 Metre Hill. We also received a telephone
message from Lao-tieh Shan telling us that a body
of Japanese was in position in a large flat-bottomed
ravine at the foot of 203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>We were unable to see them from any point, but
it was obvious that they had been moved there for
the decisive attack on the hill in question. In response
to a call for immediate reinforcements we
received two companies, which I sent closer to the
hill, so as to be within easy call. The roar of the
cannonade round the hill increased meanwhile.</p>

<p>Podgourski now arrived with his mines, which were
sent to the hill. The Japanese evidently intended to
destroy, if they could, every living thing on the hill
and then to occupy it. Anyhow, they delayed their
attack, which we expected every moment.</p>

<p>Just then I received bad news. While attempting
to take the trench occupied by the Japanese, Second-Lieutenant
Pogdanovitch was killed instantaneously,
and the attack failed; the 1st Company of the 28th<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Regiment lost heavily, but fought magnificently.
The death of this gallant young officer was a
heavy blow to me. There were not many like him
left.</p>

<p>“Well, if Podgourski’s mines are a failure, I don’t
know what will be our next step. God grant that
we can hold on to our positions, and then it will be
time to decide that difficult question,” I thought to
myself. Firing ceased; which meant the attack
was imminent. I ordered the reserve companies
to move right up to the foot of 203 Metre Hill; and
Colonel Irman reported this fact to General Kondratenko,
and asked for two more companies to
reinforce him.</p>

<p>Colonel Irman and I rode to Akasaka Yama,
where one had a better view of the positions and of
203 Metre Hill, but though the attack was at its
height, we did not see a single Japanese. Apparently
they were attacking along the narrow strip of cliff
on 203 Metre Hill which was hidden from view from
all our positions. We concluded that the assault
was being driven home in small detached parties.</p>

<p>The rifle fire directed on 203 Metre Hill from all
the neighbouring hills occupied by the Japanese
was simply terrific. Bullets were flying in all directions;
it was dangerous to stand out in the open,
even far away to the rear, and one of my horses,
which was in a place apparently quite safe, was
hit in the foreleg. Now one of the reserve companies
had climbed up to the hill; in another hour
the second was almost there. It became necessary
to think about further reinforcements. In
an unbroken line the wounded were being brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
back from the hill. At this moment I heard heavy
rifle firing from Division Hill, but I had not a single
man to send there. If the enemy were now about
to attack there also, we should indeed be in a
very bad plight.</p>

<p>It was now that Midshipman Doudkin opened fire
with his small guns. Our telephones were silent.
The strain was awful. If the Japanese took Division
Hill, communication between 203 Metre Hill, Akasaka
Yama, and False Hill would become extremely
difficult. I reassured myself with the thought that
Fort Yi-tzu Shan would prevent the Japanese from
advancing too far. Meanwhile I sent an orderly
to Division Hill to find out what was happening there.
We had a splendid view of the rear of 203 Metre Hill,
and could clearly see what every man was doing.
We saw how the companies, on reaching the hill,
wriggled along like snakes to the different parts
of the trenches, and then disappeared into them,
how every now and then a man would make a dash
for the commandant’s bomb-proof, and then pick
his way back again to the top of the hill, how they
carried the wounded back to the dressing station—in
a word, every movement of the defenders was
plainly visible from our point of observation. For
a long time we received no reports, but at last one
came in from 203 Metre Hill. Three attacks had
been beaten back, with enormous losses to the enemy;
but the commandant felt sure that the attacks would
be renewed, and therefore considerable reinforcements
were indispensable. He also reported that
they had found it impossible to roll the mines down
upon the Japanese, and that things in general were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in a very bad way. There were very few men left,
and practically no officers.</p>

<p>Soon after Lieutenant Podgourski<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> came back from
the hill with his sailors (we had by then returned to
the staff headquarters) and promised to bring smaller
bombs, from 6 to 10 pounds in weight, on the morrow.</p>

<p>Podgourski informed us that unless we sent up
one company to 203 Metre Hill, it would be taken,
as the men were physically and morally worn out.
Fortunately, a reserve company arrived, and I immediately
sent it to the hill, and Colonel Irman sent a
despairing message for at least two more companies to
reinforce us. We heard afterwards that the sight of
the company coming to their help had had a most reassuring
effect on the commandant, officers, and men.</p>

<p>The situation seemed to be so hopeless that one
of the artillery officers suggested that the hill should
be abandoned, since there was no hope of holding it.
But Major Stempnevski was the first to say that,
even though every one else left the hill, he would
remain with his one company. Captain Alander
supported him, declaring that if the 2nd Company
remained, the 4th would stand by it. Just at this
moment the reinforcing company was seen coming
up. A ringing cheer went up, and the heroic defence
continued. It was reported from Division Hill that
the enemy had occupied a position in front of the
hill and opened a very heavy rifle fire; to which we
replied that the enemy had apparently no reserves
there, and that this was probably only a demonstration,
as it eventually turned out to be.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The Japanese attacking 203 Metre Hill did not
merely restrict themselves to ground unswept by
fire from any point, but would have crept up the
northern side of the hill, had they not been driven
back by the fire from Akasaka Yama and those
trenches on 203 Metre Hill which were more or less
undamaged. As a result they showed themselves
there no more.</p>

<p>In the evening (September 21) two companies of
the 14th Regiment arrived. Captain Yarsevitch,
commanding one of them, was well known to all
for his courage and enterprise. I gave him the
necessary orders, and expressed the hope that his
company would drive the Japanese out of the trench
captured by them, and that the hill would be ours.
Reinforced by these companies the commandant was
to make a counter-attack, and I felt sure that they
would clear the hill of the Japanese during the
night. The companies of the 14th Regiment marched
off. Having asked for permission to have a rest
(he was utterly worn out), Major Stempnevski (sen.)
came to the staff headquarters that evening. With
him were relieved the 2nd and 4th Companies of the
5th Regiment, and the 1st Company of the 28th
Regiment. The men of the last mentioned had lost
heart somewhat, and were in a state of exhaustion
after the three days’ ceaseless fighting.</p>

<p>Colonel Irman and I met the gallant companies
and showered on them thanks and praise. The men
were in good spirits, but one could not see their faces
for the thick coating of dust on them.</p>

<p>In place of the companies I had withdrawn, I sent
the 2nd Company of the 13th Regiment and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
4th Company of the 28th, and appointed Captain
Sichev commandant of the hill in place of Major
Stempnevski (sen.).</p>

<p>Night fell. Everything was apparently quiet.
At times the enemy fired a few heavy shell at 203
Metre Hill, at other times rifle firing broke out and
then again ceased, while occasionally the star-rockets,
fired from the hill, brilliantly lit up the
enemy’s positions, and the heavy guns on our
hills fired a few rounds, the riflemen meanwhile
opening fire on any Japanese caught out in the
open.</p>

<p>Colonel Irman, Captain Baum,<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Lieutenant Kostoushko,<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
and I sat in the staff headquarters, deliberating
as to what was to be done with the Japanese
who had got into our trench on 203 Metre Hill. It
seemed to us that without very careful organization
a counter-attack would not stand much chance of
success by day. On the other hand, it was impossible
to make this attack in the night, as the
enemy could concentrate large reserves against us,
follow us up the hill, and, completely outnumbering
us, creep close up behind as we withdrew,
and finally drive us entirely off the hill.</p>

<p>In view of the paramount necessity for decisive
action on 203 Metre Hill, I had already sent Major
Stempnevski (who had had a certain amount of
rest) back with 20 men who had volunteered from
the 2nd and 4th Companies of my regiment. As he
knew every inch of 203 Metre Hill, Major Stempnevski
was ordered to assist the new commandant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>in organizing an attack on the Japanese then in
occupation of our bomb-proofs.</p>

<p>Considering the importance of the intended attack,
I wished to go myself to the hill. I sent to General
Kondratenko for two more companies, but he refused
to let me have them, proposing to undertake some
movement himself. Thus it but remained for me
to see in the morning from what part I could best
withdraw two companies.</p>

<p>At this moment an officer was brought in on a
stretcher, and I was horrified to see that it was our
gallant Captain Yarsevitch, wounded in the chest.
I ran to him and asked him if he was badly hurt,
whereupon he pointed to his right breast, saying in
a very feeble voice: “It’s nothing—I shall get over
it. It’s all right on the hill ... they can fight a bit
longer ... successfully ... but they must be relieved
... they have had no sleep and are deadbeat. Let
them take me to the hospital.” Having assured
him that his wound was not dangerous, we turned
away determined that we would get men, cost what
it might, to relieve the garrison of the hill, knowing,
however, that it was almost an impossibility, as <i>we</i>
had no men, and in the centre,<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> where there were
some reserves, they might be more needed than
with us, seeing that there also the fighting had
been very fierce. Not without cause had General
Kondratenko left us to our own devices.</p>

<p>Captain Yarsevitch was wounded as he rushed at
the head of his company on the trench occupied by
the Japanese. Met by a hot fire, and seeing the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>fall of their commander, the men picked him up
and ran back. How important it is that a company
should respect and love its commanding officer!
The men did everything for him that could possibly
be done.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 22nd the cannonade,
with its resulting stream of wounded from 203 Metre
Hill, recommenced. The reserves had not arrived,
but we received information that the enemy was
collecting in large force under 203 Metre Hill. One
might almost say that we were helpless, as we had
not a single man in reserve.</p>

<p>Then an order came from General Smirnov directing
us “To send immediately two quick-firing guns to
the rear against the Japanese collecting under
203 Metre Hill.” Colonel Irman, Colonel Romanovski,
Major Gobiato, and other gunner officers had a
long discussion as to which guns were to be withdrawn.
At last they decided to telephone to
Lieutenant Yasinski to move from the Lao-tieh
Shan positions through the <i>kao-liang</i> towards
Pigeon Bay, to the rear of the Japanese. The
message was sent, and Colonel Irman himself rode
off in that direction, leaving me at the telephone.
Scarcely two hours had passed before some one
caught sight of him galloping towards our headquarters
as hard as he could ride. We ran out to
meet him. “Victory! Victory!” shouted our Colonel,
riding up to the door. We deluged him with
questions.</p>

<p>“The Japanese are in full retreat from under
203 Metre Hill and the trenches near it,” he shouted
as he dismounted. Lieutenant Yasinski had ranged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
on the very centre of them, in one minute had
destroyed half of them, and in another most of the
survivors. Completely demoralized, off they went
helter-skelter, like partridges, and even evacuated
their trenches on Saddle Hill.</p>

<p>We were like mad people; I do not think I had
ever experienced such a feeling of joy.</p>

<p>A little later Lieutenant Podgourski arrived with
his small 6–10 lb. bombs. But as we had no
reserves we could not withdraw a single man, the
enemy being in force before all the hills.</p>

<p>Podgourski proceeded to 203 Metre Hill. Everything
was quiet there now; even the rifle fire had
ceased. I still awaited the advent of the two
companies which I intended to send up to drive
off the Japanese, because I put such little faith
in the efficiency of the bombs. It seemed to
me that those who had to throw them would
not be able to get near enough to the Japanese
trenches.</p>

<p>Hardly an hour had passed since Podgourski’s
departure, when several terrific explosions were
heard from 203 Metre Hill, followed by some dozen
minor ones and then an outburst of rifle fire.
We heard a “Hurrah!” shouted through the telephone.
The Japanese were decimated by the
bombs, and the remainder shot as they ran down
the hill. Our spirits rose, and a gasp of relief
was heard on the receipt of this message. I immediately
sent a report of the result to General
Kondratenko.</p>

<p>This is what had taken place. On the arrival
of Lieutenant Podgourski, Captain Sichev, Major<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Stempnevski and Captain Kramorenko (to whose
initiative the attack was mainly due) formed the
following plan: to call for volunteers among the
officers and men to attack the Japanese with
the bombs, to divide them into two parties, and,
on a rocket being fired, one party to act from
one flank of the trench and the other from the
other flank. Lieutenant Podgourski was to take
charge of one party. As arranged, the two parties
started off in absolute silence towards their objectives.
Then Lieutenant Podgourski with three
volunteers, Riflemen Trufanov and Butorin of
the 4th Company of the 5th Regiment, and
Fomeenitch, a sailor, wriggled up on their
stomachs to the trench, and there set the fuses of
their bombs. The distance was yet rather far for
throwing, but as it seemed impossible to crawl any
nearer without being observed, they decided to have
a try. Fomeenitch was the first to throw his bomb,
but it fell short. The enemy did not pay the slightest
attention. As the signal had not yet been given,
it was decided not to throw any more bombs
for the present. Then, seeing that they were not in
a good position for throwing, Lieutenant Podgourski
and Fomeenitch crawled along to the other flank
and joined Captain Kramorenko’s detachment. They
then succeeded in getting quite close to the bomb-proofs,
and Lieutenant Podgourski threw his bomb,
which, however, also fell short.</p>

<p>“Let me have another try, sir,” said Fomeenitch
to Lieutenant Podgourski, and the 10-lb. missile,
hurled with a strong arm and true aim, fell right
into the entrance to the bomb-proof. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
deafening roar, and a great column of smoke,
combined with fragments of planks, beams, iron
girders, and shattered limbs, shot high into the air.
All the other men then ran out into the open
and threw their bombs. With a terrific roar the
bomb-proofs were blown to pieces. Clods of earth,
pieces of planks and beams, and fragments of human
bodies fell all round our brave fellows. Those of
the Japanese who were left alive fled down the
hill, but were all shot down by Captain Kramorenko’s
men. All was over in two minutes.<a id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Praise and all honour to Podgourski and Kramorenko!
Our joy knew no bounds, whereas the
Japanese were literally dumbfounded.</p>

</div>

<p>Their futile, but desperate, attacks had cost them
some thousands of men,<a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
whose bodies were strewn
over all the slopes of 203 Metre Hill and choked the
ravines at the foot of it.</p>

<p>On the following day (September 23) we collected
a number of rifles and digging tools. We walked
freely about 203 Metre Hill and its environs, and
did not hear a single shot from the Japanese. The
enemy’s artillery also was silent, and if we had only
had one more division, we could have retaken all
our old positions, the Japanese having apparently
abandoned them.</p>

<p>Parties of Chinese were sent out to collect the
bodies on 203 Metre Hill, and they dug pits on the
spot and buried the dead in them. Our men were
laid to rest near the headquarters of the staff. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>of the dead had lain for a long time in the trenches
on 203 Metre Hill among its living defenders.</p>

<p>Rest ye in peace, brave men! Your heroic
deeds will bear such fruit on Russian soil that thousands
like unto you will arise hereafter.</p>

<p class="hang small">Making good damages, and strengthening and supplementing the works
on the various hills.</p>

<p class="noindent">The following morning (September 24) the damage
done to our trenches and batteries was thoroughly
surveyed, and we at once eagerly set to work to
renew those that had been ruined, and to complete
those left untouched.</p>

<p>Several bomb-proofs had been shattered by heavy
shell, while some had collapsed owing to the shells
striking the parapet on which the baulks supporting
the roofs rested.</p>

<p>The trenches themselves were so very shallow
that one could not stand upright in the blindages.
General Fock, who also came to the hill to inspect
the works, was very much dissatisfied. He gave
orders that the trenches should be deepened to
7 feet (the ground was solid rock), and the overhead
cover of the blindages strengthened by a thickness
of stone sufficient to render them proof against heavy
shells (3½ feet stone and 14 inches earth); that
the 6- and 8-inch beams holding the roofs should
be supported on 8-inch uprights; that a bomb-proof
should be made for the commandant and
officers, and for the sergeant-major and the non-commissioned
officers; that the battery on the right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
flank should be made into a redoubt; that a redoubt
should be hewn out of the rock on the left flank
and supplied with an inner ditch, 3 feet deep, with
vertical sides; and that an abattis of wire entanglements
should be constructed in front of it, and
bomb-proofs with iron roofs inside it.</p>

<p>Throughout this day wagons containing every
kind of material made their way to 203 Metre Hill.
Workmen swarmed on the hill like bees, but the
enemy did not disturb us by a single shot.</p>

<p>I was glad to find that two sapper officers were
placed under my orders—Major Gemmelmann, and
Ensign Yermakov, a capable and practical man.
I detailed the latter to supervise the work in progress
on the top of 203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>His idea was to resort to blasting, and I was in
complete accord, as our digging tools were almost
worthless in the hard rocky soil.</p>

<p>I had already drawn the trace of a redoubt for one
company on Akasaka Yama, the soil of which was
similar, and had put Major Mousious there with
his company to make it.</p>

<p>I gave orders for the existing trenches on False
Hill to be bent back so that the slopes of 203 Metre
Hill could be swept by fire from the south-west.
Everywhere work was being pushed forward at
top speed.</p>

<p>Paralysed by their defeats, the Japanese showed
no signs of life for three days. During these three
days the hundred or so of Chinamen whom we
employed were unable to collect all the bodies, and
it was hardly possible to breathe on 203 Metre Hill
from the overpowering stench. The bodies of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Japanese remained in the ravines near the hill until
the very end of the siege.</p>

<p>I had succeeded in obtaining some hundreds
of poods of barbed wire, and with this I hoped
to be able to render 203 Metre Hill impregnable
against all ordinary attacks. The work became
interesting to the whole garrison, and especially so
to the 5th Regiment, whose honour was bound up
in the fate of that bloodstained height.</p>

<p>After the September attacks had failed, we had
a fairly quiet time in my section of the defence,
and my first thought was to give the companies
occupying 203 Metre Hill every opportunity of resting.</p>

<p>We replaced them with others, and the defenders
were quartered near the headquarters of the staff.
O God! I shall never forget the sight they presented
as they descended the hill. Emaciated, ragged,
and so caked with dirt that it was impossible to see
the colour of their faces, but in splendid spirits
nevertheless. All the companies had lost at least
two-thirds of their strength in killed and wounded.
Colonel Irman and I took it in turns to compliment
and praise them. There were only 70 of my men
left. On my recommending some of them for St.
George’s Crosses, I received the ironical reply from
General Fock that “out of 70 men I had recommended
half for rewards.” General Fock forgot, of
course, that these 70 represented one-third of the
original strength, and that there had been more
than 200 of them originally<a id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> on 203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>Seeing that the Japanese had become quite listless,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>we began to work openly by day. This made
things much easier for us everywhere, and especially
on Akasaka Yama and the left flank of Division Hill.</p>

<p>Almost the whole of the 27th Regiment was placed
under my orders for the manning of our defensive
positions and fighting line, which were, on the whole,
very weak. As they did not come all together, but
arrived by companies, they were posted on different
hills, as were also companies of other regiments
which were sent up at various times.</p>

<p>By General Kondratenko’s orders the 5th Regiment
was distributed over all the hills, in order to
render the defence more stubborn.</p>

<p>Leaving us in comparative peace, the Japanese
began to bombard the town on September 24, and
it became dangerous to walk about in it.</p>

<p>Our central forts also had begun to suffer from
the enemy’s gun fire. We constantly saw big shells
bursting near Forts Yi-tzu Shan and Ta-an-tzu Shan.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>From the beginning of September it began to get
cold at night, and we had to think of making winter
arrangements for the troops. Again we had to
collect material and carry it on to the position,
but how could our horses do this work without
fodder? It was not good for the men either to be
without meat. We had had no beef from September
10, and were eating nothing but horse-flesh.</p>

<p>In the summer the men could be quartered in the
actual fighting line; officers and men slept in the
open air in their trenches, or in tents pitched in safe
positions behind the trenches. But this was impossible
in the winter. So, by my orders, warm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
bomb-proofs (of the type shown in Plate No. II.),
designed by the company commanders themselves,
were constructed in the trenches. We had also to
make closed-in places for the company kitchens,
and, lastly, we had to have baths, as the men were
beginning to suffer greatly from vermin.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>We wanted an enormous number of sand-bags for
completing the trenches, and barbed wire for making
entanglements. Our regimental supplies of material
and tools had, therefore, to be augmented, and we
had also to hunt about for carpenters.</p>

<p>The gunners were appealed to for help to bring up
everything needed on to the positions, and in response
they gave us several dozen four-horsed wagons.</p>

<p>Thanks to the short rest and peace that reigned
in our section, both officers and men somewhat recovered
their spirits. On various pretexts officers
began to collect at the staff headquarters and in the
quarters of the officer commanding the western front.</p>

<p>Various rumours, exaggerated of course, were
recounted, the probable intentions of the Japanese
were discussed, and interesting anecdotes related;
in a word, we were all in the best of spirits in spite
of the meagreness of our table, which boasted little
more than horse-flesh and horse-radish.</p>

<p>With what zest did we not devour that bitter
root! There was plenty of vodka and wine to be
had, but I hardly ever saw any one drunk.</p>

<p>The enemy now turned all his attention to our
centre,<a id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and the roar of gun and rifle fire rolled down
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>to us continuously from that quarter. I often,
during my tour of inspection round the positions,
saw curling puffs of smoke from bursting shrapnel
over the forts in the centre.</p>

<p>It was not by any means pleasant in the town.
Shells fell not only on the houses, but on the hospitals.
A shell bursting in the town wounded our
Paymaster, Lieutenant Frost, in the face and head,
Second-Lieutenant Bobirev in the head, Father Vasili
slightly in the head, and Captain Felitzin also. I
therefore ordered the horses to be picketed on the
left flank, near the staff of the 28th Regiment, as it
was unsafe to leave them in their old places on Red
Hill. The advantage of the strong bomb-proofs
which I had made for the reserves behind Red Hill,
and on the right flank in front of the naval barracks,
in the very heart of the town, was now apparent.</p>

<p>On October 1 we learnt that the enemy had brought
up 11-inch howitzers. This was serious news for us.
One could feel that 203 Metre Hill was practically
safe against 6-inch projectiles, but 11-inch were
a very different matter. I had thought that the
enemy would never be able to take 203 Metre
Hill and Akasaka Yama. What was to be done
now?</p>

<p>Colonel Irman and I thought long and earnestly
over this difficult question, but we could see only one
solution—to delve deeper into the rock. We decided
to do so, hoping that the accuracy of the 11-inch
howitzers would not be very great, though I must
acknowledge that I did not put much faith in this
supposition. Report said that the 11-inch shells were
coming from behind Feng-huang Shan, which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
only 5 versts from our positions, and I knew what
our long 10-inch guns could do at 10 versts.</p>

<p>That evening a large number of officers gathered
in the staff headquarters, officers of all arms being
present, among whom there was much discussion
and talk about the 11-inch howitzers. Finally they
comforted themselves with somebody’s remark that
Port Arthur would not be taken by one 11-inch gun.</p>

<p>Thereupon some began to protest against such an
argument. “Why do you think,” they said, “that
the Japanese have only one 11-inch gun, and not a
dozen?” “Because it would be a very difficult
and long business to bring them up and put them in
position; and besides, where would they get them
from?” “Then where have they got the 700,000
men from, instead of the 350,000 we gave them
credit for?” This question was unanswerable.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The Japanese had made no move for some time,
but now they again began to show signs of activity.
It was October 3; on 203 Metre Hill our men were
sitting round the samovars,<a id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> which they had placed
on the road, and were cleaning their clothes and
mending their boots, which had suffered sadly on
that stony ground. I went to the upper redoubt,
where I found that good progress had been made,
thanks to the successful blasting. Only a short
time ago we had made the trace<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> of the redoubt,
and now it was fully capable of defence. The drainage
and water-supply systems on the top of the hill
were nearing completion. Colonel Doubeedi, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Naval Construction Department, who had at my
request been detailed to supervise the construction
of the fortifications in my section, procured for us
many tools and much material. He had obtained a
steam-engine and pipes for pumping up water, and
promised that in a week there would be a tank on
the hill with as much water as was needed; and,
judging by the present rate of progress, this seemed
very probable.</p>

<p>That night our sentries reported that great numbers
of the enemy were working between Saddle Hill and
Namako Yama, and when I came to look next
morning I saw an unbroken line of trenches, revetted
with sand-bags, stretching from Saddle Hill to Namako
Yama. On a not far-distant hillock, lying to the
west, I noticed a short length of trench, also revetted,
and the enemy was apparently working at it from
both sides. It was a sap!</p>

<p>From three points of the trench between Akasaka
Yama and Saddle Hill the Japanese had begun to
make passages for sapping operations. Hurrah! the
enemy had had enough of direct attacks and was
going to undertake regular siege works against our
trenches.</p>

<p>I went from 203 Metre Hill to Akasaka Yama.
Good progress had been made there, and now it
was possible to live in the trenches, and a stubborn
defence might be reckoned on. From Akasaka
Yama I had to cross over to Division Hill. This had
to be done as quickly as possible, as the Japanese
always fired on men crossing in the open, and the
need of a communication trench between those
points was becoming very pressing. I was very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
tired after my tramp through the trenches, and
by the time I reached the 7th Company on
Division Hill I was panting for breath. All the
enemy’s works against my section were to be clearly
seen from here. Every hill and mound that were
so familiar to me were crowned with Japanese
trenches. They had closed in towards us considerably,
and the approaches between the front and rear
lines of trenches were plainly visible. Behind Extinct
Volcano I saw a typical sap with traverses,
leading straight up towards the left flank of Division
Hill. Through my glasses I could actually see the
men at work.</p>

<p>I explained the significance of these works to
officers and men on all the hills, and ordered the
former to call for volunteers and make sorties, to
destroy the sap-heads and the men working in them;
in this way I gave full scope to Russian enterprise,
which I always encouraged in every way I could
think of.</p>

<p>The capture of Namako Yama made intercommunication
along the rear of our positions extremely
difficult. Now we had to construct a regular network
of communication trenches, entailing very
heavy work. I was fortunate in having Major
Gemmelmann, Ensign Yermakov, and Lieutenant
Fetter with me to assist me with my field fortifications.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for me now to point out the
position of each trench, for our officers fully understood
the end and object of sappers’ work, and
were themselves competent to undertake it.</p>

<p>The fearful effect of small hand grenades demonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to us the necessity of having a store or magazine
of them, so Colonel Irman applied to General
Kondratenko, who lost no time in giving the necessary
orders.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Melik-Porsadanov was ordered to construct
a melinite factory, and was given the necessary
men for working it. In a few days we were able
to test the efficiency of this factory. Before, however,
we utilized its products, our gunners proposed
that they should fire some of these small shell at
the enemy from their mountain guns, using time
fuzes. Some hundreds were immediately supplied to
them, with instructions in their use. They were
distributed among the gunners in the advanced
positions.</p>

<p>From this time, in the evenings, we set to work to
devise a means of replacing the slow-match in the
grenades by some kind of firing mechanism. Our
miners showed the highest inventive powers and
thought out and tried several excellent designs. It
is a pity that they took such a long time to make,
as Bickford’s slow-match remained to the end of the
siege practically the only method of ignition. The
soldiers, as was natural, were all for having grenades
that would burst on impact.</p>

<p>A grenade with a slow-match is a very imperfect
weapon. One has only to put oneself in the place
of a rifleman, almost face to face with the enemy,
lighting the slow-match of the grenade in a wind.
The match is blown out—he lights another; but the
enemy is all the time climbing up closer and closer.
At last the slow-match catches, the grenade is thrown
amongst the enemy, in a second there is a fearful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
explosion, and the foe has disappeared. There is
nothing left but a pall of black smoke, and over it,
high into the air, fly scraps of clothing and portions
of human bodies—arms, legs, and heads. That
is roughly the effect of a 5-lb. pyroxylin bomb.
Our men give a shout of “Hurrah!” and the survivors
of the stupefied enemy fly headlong down the
hill and hide in their trenches. But it sometimes
happens that the slow-match goes out, or the
bomb bursts after the enemy has passed it. For
the future, before the outbreak of war, some kind
of practical mechanism must be fitted to pyroxylin
and melinite grenades.</p>

<p>On October 19 our gallant Colonel Irman rode into
the staff quarters wounded in the thigh. I had told
him times out of number not to expose himself in
the trenches.</p>

<p>Whilst going from one trench to another on False
Hill he had had a good lesson for the future! Thank
God! the bullet did not touch the bone. He was
a very brave man, our Colonel, but somewhat foolhardy,
and as the officer commanding the whole of
the western front of the defensive line he should
have been more careful.</p>

<p>I was nearly always with him, and formerly it was
most exceptional for me to be on one of the positions
without him. But as time passed, it became evident
that one of us must always be near the telephone at
our headquarters, so that orders could be passed
along without a moment’s delay.</p>

<p>The first section of the western front was mine,
but as other sections under Colonel Irman’s command
were as yet out of reach of the enemy’s fire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
he made his headquarters within the circle of my
section, and when the enemy compelled me to move
my headquarters to a less dangerous spot, I had them
placed in line with the headquarters of the officer
commanding the western front, which was altogether
a better arrangement.</p>

<p>After the 27th Regiment had occupied Akasaka
Yama and the companies of the 4th Reserve Battalion
were distributed over various parts of the defensive
line, they began to send sailors into the reserve.
They were very fine men, these sailors, but where
patience, forbearance, and knowledge of infantry
tactics are essential, they should never be sent, as
they are then worse than useless.</p>

<p>For instance, the left redoubt on 203 Metre Hill
was occupied by some sailors. Tea-time came, and
the sailors, under the very eyes of the enemy, left the
redoubt one by one and descended the hill without
even posting sentries. I do not remember what I
wanted, but I had sent an orderly to the redoubt.
A minute later he came hurrying back, fully understanding
the danger of the situation, and reported:
“There is no one at all in the redoubt, sir!” Of
course I sent some men of the reserve there at once,
and sent all the naval officers—who refused to believe
that their men could have been capable of such
folly—after the sailors.</p>

<p>I had a lot of trouble with the sailors. Sometimes
they had no kettles, sometimes they had no
warm clothing and had to be supplied from the
regiment, at other times they were tired and wanted
rest, and so on, and so on; but they were splendid
fighters, especially if they were led by good officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>However, now we had to consider what was
to be done about the Japanese saps, gradually
lengthening in our direction. After careful inspection
we found that they had made the following:
against 203 Metre Hill, parallels from the west
and north; a long approach from beyond Namako
Yama, right across the valley; against Division
Hill at some distance from it, several separate
parallels.</p>

<p>About two days after the construction of the
parallels under 203 Metre Hill we noticed several
sap-heads, the parapets of which were made entirely
of sand-bags; apparently the rocky nature of
the soil made it impossible to dig down deeply.</p>

<p>About two days later the approaches under 203
Metre Hill were plainly visible. There were five of
them—two from the west and three from the north.</p>

<p>From the rear of Extinct Volcano one approach
had been made towards the left flank of Division
Hill. Thanks to the use of sand-bags made of straw
the enemy got on fairly quickly. Sometimes more
than a sagene (7 feet) was made in a night.<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> We
carefully watched their progress.</p>

<p>Sorties on a small scale, organized by the commandants
of the hills, were made to try to hinder
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>the work. We also decided to ask General Kondratenko
from time to time to order all the howitzers
in the fortress to concentrate their fire on those
points where the enemy was making headway with
his sapping operations. This would have been
excellent if the fire of the howitzers had been more
accurate, but we ourselves sometimes suffered from
their bad shooting. We were particularly afraid of
the large naval guns, whose shells frequently fell
inconveniently near us. However, they caused the
enemy, too, a good deal of annoyance. It was
unfortunate that, owing to the scarcity of ammunition,
they were not able to keep up a continuous fire.
If work on the saps was noticed by day, we kept up
a heavy rifle fire on the sap-heads. The bullets
evidently penetrated the sand-bags, as the enemy
stopped putting them up, and only began work
again, with much caution, when firing ceased. In
order to prevent them from working at night, I
ordered supports to be made for the rifles, which
were laid with the greatest care on the sap-heads,
and all night firing was kept up from these rifles.
On General Fock’s advice we clamped the rifles
down with sods and earth so that they could not
move out of position.<a id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>As we could use our field guns with effect against
the sap-heads on the left flank of Division Hill,
I obtained one gun and placed it on the top of
Division Hill, absolutely screened from the enemy’s
view, and opened fire on the head of the sap. The
third shot struck it fairly, and, scattering the sand-bags,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>opened up the trench inside. In about three days
the excellent practice made by this gun compelled
the enemy to stop working that sap altogether, and
I felt in consequence considerably easier in my mind
about Division Hill. But the sapping proceeded
surely and steadily round 203 Metre Hill. Our
sorties were the only effective means of checking the
work.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention our successful sorties against
the saps on the left flank of Division Hill. We had
there our 1st Scout Detachment and the 3rd, 7th,
and 12th Companies of the 5th Regiment. Our
Scouts under Acting Ensign Elechevski, a fine
officer of our regiment, made two very successful
sorties, besides several rather fruitless ones. On
each occasion the Japanese were annihilated by
grenades and bayonet charges, and their earth-works
demolished. After these sorties, and the excellent
firing of my field gun, no further progress was
made with that sap; but the firing from Extinct
Volcano and Namako Yama gave us no rest. In
order to secure the left flank of Division Hill,
and to afford means of communication therewith,
we had to dig trenches in rear and communication
passages at least 2 versts in length. The work
was carried out under Lieutenant Kostoushko (who
was my orderly officer towards the latter end of
the siege) with only a limited number of men. It
was very heavy work. Owing to the carelessness
and indifference to danger of our men never a
day passed without some casualties.</p>

<p>During the first weeks of October the Japanese
made themselves very strong opposite our centre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
(Fort Erh-lung, and West Pan-lung Redoubt, and the
valley of the Lun-ho), and, as with us on 203 Metre
Hill and Akasaka Yama, rifle firing there did not
cease day or night, and Japanese shell from every
kind of gun fell constantly round the positions.</p>

<p>When making my inspections, I often watched the
enemy’s movements against our central positions
from Division Hill. I had an excellent view of the
ground in front of Forts Erh-lung and Sung-shu.
On one occasion I observed something very interesting
and instructive, which I will now describe.</p>

<p>While selecting a position for a field howitzer and
one quick-firing gun on Division Hill, I went over
to the extreme right flank and saw in front of me
the following picture. Forts Erh-lung and Sung-shu
were literally swept by a storm of shell, and from the
ravines below great masses of Japanese infantry were
climbing up towards the forts in question, and we
could clearly see their lines of skirmishers on the open
ground. This movement was apparently unnoticed
from Forts Erh-lung and Sung-shu, but from Fort
Yi-tzu Shan everything must have been visible quite
plainly.</p>

<p>“Why,” I thought to myself, “does not Fort Yi-tzu
Shan fire?” I asked the question by telephone,
and was informed in reply that ammunition was
scarce in the fort and had to be reserved exclusively
for beating off assaults. I immediately gave orders
for fire to be opened on the enemy advancing on
Fort Erh-lung.</p>

<div class="center-img-landscape" id="image_Page_210">

    <p class="x-small left">p. 210]</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Fire was opened, and I had the pleasure of seeing
that our shells compelled the Japanese skirmishers
to take cover in the folds of the ground. After this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
our firing ceased and the lines again came out and
began climbing up towards the fort and the battery.</p>

<p>I gave orders for the firing to be renewed, but
received the answer that all ammunition had
been expended and more would not arrive before
nightfall, even if sent for immediately; and this
when the Japanese had already got almost up to
the glacis and had begun digging themselves in right
under the eyes of all our artillery.</p>

<p>Surely, under such circumstances, this was absolutely
irrational. If they had only had some ammunition
at Fort Yi-tzu Shan, the Japanese would
have been swept away from the ground in front of
Fort Erh-lung like dust before a broom, as there
they were within short range of our guns. In reality,
however, they were in an untenable position, facing as
they were the heavy long-range guns in Fort Erh-lung,
and being enfiladed from Fort Yi-tzu Shan,
which was also well armed. In consequence of a
similar economy in gun ammunition they had also
been left in undisputed possession of Namako Yama
and Extinct Volcano.</p>

<p>Report has it that great numbers of shell were
taken after the surrender of the fortress, so why
was the enemy allowed to remain, unmolested by
artillery, in positions close up to our lines?</p>

<p>It is true that the heavy guns on Fort Ta-yang-ku
North did on several occasions damage the Japanese
trenches on Extinct Volcano, but a continuous fire
should have been directed at this hill, so as to prevent
the enemy from attacking the left flank of
Division Hill and firing at our men in the communication
trenches in rear.</p>

<p class="noindent">On my inspections now I had to run and jump like
a goat from traverse to traverse, and even crawl
on all-fours. I had indeed good reason for complaining
more often perhaps than any one else of the
inaction of our artillery.</p>

<p>Not long before this the Japanese smashed up our
water-cart as it was wending its way to Division
Hill. Well, we ate the horses, but the cart itself
was shattered to pieces, and all because our guns
allowed the enemy to get too close up to our positions.</p>

<p>Thank God! the Japanese could not see our staff
headquarters, or otherwise the structure would have
been razed to the ground. Stray shells alone caused
a certain amount of damage to it, so one can imagine
what would have happened if the opposing artillery
had actually ranged on it.</p>

<p>A short time ago, when the Japanese sent up a
balloon, I climbed on to the roof of one of the buildings
to see if we were visible to the men in its car.</p>

<p>I could see the balloon distinctly through my telescope,
but it seemed very doubtful if the Japanese
could see the chimneys of our houses, so we no longer
worried about their safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>I have already said that the Japanese sapping
operations near 203 Metre Hill were progressing apace,
and consequently we were now racking our brains
to devise means of impeding their work. I proposed
making a sortie on a large scale. In order to ensure
its success, I took a photograph from 203 Metre Hill
of our own and the Japanese works, and told Major
Fofanov, the officer commanding our 5th Company,
whom I had selected to lead the sortie, to make
a careful study of the ground himself, but in the end
our senior officers refused to give us permission to
make any sortie on a large scale. We had, consequently,
to be content with a series of small ones.
Numbers of men always volunteered for these sorties,
of whom Acting Ensign Makurin and Rifleman
Stoliarov of the 1st Scout Detachment especially
distinguished themselves.</p>

<p>One of their sorties was brilliantly successful. The
Japanese in the saps and trenches were bayoneted,
the trenches were wrecked, and a quantity of digging
tools was captured, while our own losses were insignificant.
One sortie, however, made by Makurin
on the night of October 20–21, was a failure, probably
for the reason that the Japanese had anticipated
it, and our men were thus met by rifle fire
and hand grenades. Our losses were heavy, Makurin
himself being severely wounded in the arm.</p>

<p>These sorties were our only means of combating
the Japanese sap work, until at last we discovered a
new method—one that had been tried by Midshipman
Vlassev in the centre of our positions. A description
of the procedure was given us when we were all
drinking tea (of which we always had a plentiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
supply) in the staff headquarters, and we promptly
decided to try the experiment ourselves.</p>

<p>The following day we dragged a 42-linia<a id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> gun
to 203 Metre Hill, mounted it in a trench and, with
General Kondratenko’s permission, asked Midshipman
Vlassev to come over. Under his direction a
stick about 4 feet long was fixed into the base of
a cylindro-conical shell of calibre 41·5 linia. This
wooden tail was pushed down the bore of the gun,
which was previously charged with a small quantity
of powder. On firing, the shell with its tail flew
towards the enemy’s sap, where the 20-lb. charge of
pyroxylin exploded, and destroyed all the enemy’s
works as well as the men engaged in constructing them.
Midshipman Vlassev and Major Gobiato (a gunner)
undertook to try this method of firing. Though the
first few shots were not successful, the wooden tail
being either burnt up or broken, and the shell failing
to drop where it was intended, they nevertheless
struck fear into the hearts of the Japanese! Afterwards
firing became more accurate, and the shells
frequently fell right into the trenches.</p>

<p>For future fortress warfare some practical means
must be devised for throwing 20-lb. charges a short distance
with precision, and then close approach will be
rendered so difficult as to be almost an impossibility.</p>

<p>Having noted the position of this dangerous gun,
the enemy directed a tremendous fire upon it, but
it took him a month to dismount it, and then only
because it was impossible for us to protect it in the
trenches from the constant fall of heavy shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The discharge of these great tailed shell was watched
with the greatest interest by our riflemen. But the
enemy, not to be outdone, also began to discharge large
mines at us, the effect of the explosion of which was
considerably greater than that of his 11-inch shell,
but their striking effect was weak and limited to
a terrific roar and an indescribable volume of
smoke.</p>

    <p class="x-small">BLINDAGE ON THE LEFT FLANK OF 203 METRE HILL. THE MEN ARE RIFLEMEN OF THE 2ND COMPANY,
5TH REGIMENT.</p>
    <p class="x-small left">p. 215]</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>During the last month the work of fortifying 203
Metre Hill had made rapid progress. One could walk
freely about the trenches now, without the risk of
knocking one’s head against the cross-beams in the
blindages. Dug-outs had been made in the rear
face of the trenches, so that a third of the defenders
could turn in at night and obtain proper rest. The
blindages in the most exposed places had been
strengthened with rails and ½-inch iron plates, with
earth and stone piled up on them to a height of about
6 feet, and the loop-holes were furnished with ½-inch
iron shields, with a cross-shaped aperture in the
middle for the rifle, so that the men felt themselves
fairly safe when exchanging fire with the Japanese.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the enemy began noticeably
to increase his fire on the hill from 11-inch howitzers.
One shell hit a traverse 9 feet thick, blew it to
pieces, in spite of the fact that it was nearly all solid
rock, and wrecked all the passages round it. I went
to see what damage had been done, and saw that it
would need a great deal of work to repair it. The
passage round the traverse had been blown out
to a depth of 7 feet. Three riflemen, who were
standing alongside the traverse near an embrasure,
were killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>I asked the men: “Well, how do you like this
kind of visitor? Do you find it trying?” “Not
a bit, sir. They seldom do much damage, beyond
singeing us a bit—look there!” and a soldier
pointed to one of the hills near the Shipinsin Pass
where a puff of smoke was hanging. In another
second a huge 11-inch shell screamed over the hill,
and, striking somewhere behind, burst with a tremendous
roar. Thousands of splinters flew in all
directions. “M-iles over,” drawled one of the men
unconcernedly.</p>

<p>“That is why they have put you here,” I continued.
“Every one knows what splendid men you are—that
you will not surrender; you must be proud that you
are so honoured by the whole garrison. Men of the
5th Regiment are posted in all the most dangerous
positions.”</p>

<p>“We <i>are</i> proud, sir,” answered a chorus of
voices.</p>

<p>That is how things were when no attack was
proceeding. But the end was bound to come. The
enemy’s saps had come half-way up the hill, and we
continued to strengthen our positions.</p>

<p>203 Metre Hill had by now a complete belt of wire
entanglements round it. To further strengthen this
obstacle, I gave orders for abattis to be constructed
in it. Trees were cut down near the staff headquarters
and dragged up to the hill. In this way
an open attack was rendered an absolute impossibility.
The redoubts and trenches on Akasaka Yama
were also completed. Acting Ensign Yermakov and
Major Mousious surpassed themselves. General
Fock came to Akasaka Yama and was very satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
with the work done there, which I believe he has
mentioned in his “Notes.”<a id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>I had many companies of other regiments on the
positions in my section. As I have already said,
these companies were sent up as they were needed,
and so they became rather intermixed. This was in
every respect most undesirable, as, whenever anything
went wrong, it was impossible to determine who was
really to blame.</p>

<p>It became very evident to me that it is not by any
means the same thing whether four companies of
different units hold a position, or whether it is
defended by one battalion, under its own commander.</p>

<p>In view of this, the whole of the 27th Regiment,
with the exception of the 1st Company, was ordered
to concentrate on Akasaka Yama and the 5th
on Division Hill, 203 Metre Hill being defended as
before by the 2nd, 4th, and 6th Companies of the
5th Regiment, with four machine guns, the 1st
Company of the 27th Regiment, and the 7th Company
of the 14th Regiment under Lieutenant Vanikovski.
These men were all familiar with their
various positions, and had become indifferent to
constant danger and quite accustomed to looking
down from the top on the enemy digging below
without any particular feelings of alarm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>I must acknowledge that in view of past experience
I did not like changing my tried companies
for new ones. I therefore organized them in reliefs—two
days’ rest near the staff headquarters to one
on the position.</p>

<p>Interval Hill was occupied by one company of
the 25th Regiment under Major Veselovski. In
the reserve I had the companies of the 4th Reserve
Battalion.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Towards the end of November the fortifications
on all the hills were complete. On 203 Metre Hill
was a huge redoubt, with two keeps, completely
surrounded by wire entanglements.<a id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The interval
between 203 Metre Hill and False Hill was covered
by several rows of fougasses. Akasaka Yama was
encircled with a well-built line of trenches, and had
a strong redoubt on the top, with two weaker ones
on the right flank. On Division Hill there was a
large redoubt with two retrenchments, the fire of
which was directed towards Extinct Volcano, as an
attack, we thought, was certain to come from that
direction.</p>

<p>The communication trenches to Akasaka Yama
and Division Hill were well screened from view and
impervious to rifle fire. False Hill was also surrounded
by well-constructed trenches, with covered
communication passages leading to them.</p>

<p>The space between False Hill and Fort Ta-yang-kou
North was the only piece in the section resembling
a fortified position in the ordinary sense of
the word, and it was held by only two companies,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>and four guns of small calibre. All the hills were
self-contained and capable of making a separate
resistance, and in case of need I could reinforce
any one of them by two or three companies from
the general reserve.</p>

<p>The men on the positions lived now in much
greater comfort than before, particularly since there
was room for all in suitable covered dug-outs at
night.</p>

<p>They all had good kitchens, and on Akasaka Yama
even baths had been made. In the matter of food
there was, however, little variety, neither butter
nor beef being available. Where had the artillery
horses been taken? We saw none of them. We
often ate mules and horses that had been killed on
the positions, but some regiments were unable even
to get them. The garrison was, in consequence,
beginning to suffer from scurvy, and eventually
this cursed disease stealthily found its way in
among us also, and laid low many of our best men.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>While we were, so to speak, having an easy time
of it, important events were taking place in the centre.<a id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
Time after time we received reports from there of
the defeat of the enemy’s attacks and his heavy
losses. But we also knew that the enemy’s approaches
were within striking distance of the forts,
and that it would not be long before mining operations
would commence.</p>

<p>On the evening of November 8, I received a note
from General Kondratenko, inviting me to come and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>examine the mining work at Fort Chi-kuan,<a id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
where they could already hear the enemy’s miners
working. The main object of this examination was
to ascertain how far off their work was going on.</p>

<p>That evening I rode into Port Arthur and met
Colonel Grigorenko.<a id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Having had tea with him and
a fairly large gathering of officers, who made one
feel quite at home, we all set out in carriages for
Fort Chi-kuan, where we arrived without any
mishap.</p>

<p>In company with General Nikizhin, Colonel Reiss,
and several staff officers we passed through the north
gate of the town, where the sentry was inclined to
stop us, because, as he said, he had received no order
to let us through.</p>

<p>The road passed through some dark ravines, and
by a way which was quite unknown to me. In half
an hour’s time we reached General Nadyein’s headquarters,
which consisted of two barrack rooms, surrounded
on all sides and roofed over with several
rows of sand-bags.</p>

<p>General Nadyein had taken some time in building
this splinter-proof, and had used thousands of sand-bags
over its construction. Inside it was comfortable
and light. It stood close under a steep cliff. On
the way to it we had heard a good many bullets
whistling around, but the staff quarters themselves
were in an absolutely safe place.</p>

<p>Telephone wires on service poles radiated in all
directions from the headquarters office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>General Kondratenko and Colonel Irman joined
us here and accompanied us to the position, to the
advanced lines of which we proceeded on foot.</p>

<p>There was a continuous rattle of rifle fire from
all sides, and it was already quite dark. We proceeded
along the narrow communication passages,
sometimes coming out into a deep ravine, and
thence into the fighting trenches, where our riflemen
were standing in silence with their overcoats half
thrown open (a coat turned inside-out looks like a
rock from a distance, and the men in my section
always wore their coats like that). Occasionally
some of them would take aim and fire into the darkness.</p>

<p>Just as I was going past one of the men, he literally
deafened me for the moment with the report of
his rifle. “What are you firing at?” I asked.
“Into the trench there, sir.” “What are you firing
into the trench for?” “I saw something moving
there,” he said. I looked over the parapet. The
enemy’s trench was indeed very close,<a id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> but I doubt
if it were possible to see anything moving in it.</p>

<p>In this way we went on for a long time, now crawling
along on the ground, now standing up to our
full height, Colonel Reiss suffering most inconvenience
of all. He had to bend the whole time, as he
was so tall that otherwise his head would have been
quite a foot over the top of the parapets of the trenches.</p>

<p>At last we stopped. “What’s the matter?” we
asked of those in front. “We have to run one by one
across this piece of open ground.” I took my turn
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>to run across. There was a good deal of firing going
on here, I suppose in order to let the Japanese know
that we were on the alert. The rifle firing, however,
was accompanied by fairly frequent discharges of
what appeared to be heavy guns.</p>

<p>Having made one more turn, we saw before us a
magnificent spectacle, which at once explained the
firing we had heard. It was not gun firing, but the
bursting of the Japanese hand grenades hurled at
Fort Chi-kuan. I thought how pleasant it would be
to be hit on the head by such a projectile.</p>

<p>But it was indeed a wonderful sight. From behind
the breastwork of Chi-kuan (we were near the gorge)
hissing streams of fire, either singly or in “bouquets,”
shot high into the air and, falling into the fort,
burst with a report like that of a heavy gun.</p>

<p>For about five minutes we watched this wonderful
firework display. An officer who had been farther
to the front explained that the missiles were pyroxylin
or melinite cartridges, to which was attached
some wadding saturated with kerosene. The wadding
was lighted and the cartridge thrown into the fort
by some mechanical means, and there it burst as
soon as the “slow-match” had burnt down.</p>

<p>The Japanese hoped by this means to set fire to
the sand-bags, planks and beams that were piled
up in stacks at the entrance to the fort.</p>

<p>Not knowing how long this display would last,
we went across the entrance of the fort into a bomb-proof
on the other side without any one being injured.
Thanks to the light of some small lanterns and the
flames of the wadding which was blazing everywhere,
I was able to see that the fort was almost completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
wrecked; parapets and traverses presented an
absolutely ruined appearance, everywhere pieces of
planks and beams from blown-up bomb-proofs were
heaped up, and there were numbers of deep, wide
holes where 11-inch shell had burst.</p>

<p>I noticed several riflemen on the parapet lying
behind sand-bags. They were sentries. I also
noticed a well-built retrenchment in the principal
salient of the fort.</p>

<p>As I followed the others as quickly as possible
into the stone bomb-proof, I became conscious that
a moment before I had been somewhat uneasy as to
whether I should escape without having my face
damaged (just before I had seen a soldier with his
face and arms horribly burnt).</p>

<p>The large vaulted casemate we had entered was
filled with soldiers, quietly seated all round it.
We passed through it and turned to the left, and then
proceeded farther through several doors until we
suddenly found ourselves in the brightly lit casemate
of the officer commanding the fort. We had a short
rest there. Colonel Grigorenko explained the situation,
making it clear to us that the enemy’s mining
parties, drilling their way through in two directions,
had already got very close to the wall of the semi-caponiers
which were placed in the chief salient of
the fort, while we had counter-mined in two places.</p>

<p>It was now necessary to determine how near we
were to the enemy’s miners and to calculate the
charge required. There were very few expert miners
among officers or men. The sapper company had
been but lately formed, and its commander was a
pontoon expert, while all the other officers were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
young. Major Linder (commanding the company)
had never had any experience of mining operations,
and the only people who knew anything about them
were Colonel Grigorenko and Lieutenant-Colonel
Rashevski. The former had served with me in the
6th Battalion and knew that I had for some years
practised offensive and defensive mining operations
at the Engineer College at Kiev, and for that reason
he had asked me to come and help him at this critical
moment. According to the officer who was superintending
the work in our mines, the enemy was
extremely close, but just then they could only occasionally
hear the sound of very cautious digging.</p>

<p>After hearing this report, we all went into the
semi-caponier. We proceeded for a considerable
distance through some dark casemates, and then
came to the place where the mining was being done.
We ordered every one out of the mine and climbed
in to listen. Colonel Grigorenko and Lieutenant-Colonel
Rashevski were with me. We began to
listen, but our movements and breathing prevented
our hearing well, so my two companions went out
and I was left alone. Putting my ear close to the
wall nearest the enemy, I held my breath and listened
intently, but not a sound broke the dead silence.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that when my comrades climbed
out of the mine, which dropped down steeply in the
enemy’s direction, I felt none too happy.</p>

<p>Supposing the enemy had laid his charge and
was just about to explode it! There would not
be much of me left!</p>

<p>In my imagination I conjured up some very disquieting
pictures, and all the time not a sound from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the enemy. This rather confirmed me in the correctness
of my supposition.</p>

<p>Long and intently I listened, several times changing
my position, as my legs got stiff and cramped owing
to my not being able to stretch them out. I strained
my ears, ... not a sound. Suddenly ... a blow, a
very careful one, then ... another and another; I
tried to guess the enemy’s direction, and how far
off he was. Though the formation was somewhat of
the nature of sand-stone, still one ought to be able to
judge fairly accurately. The man was working very
cautiously with a pick, and I could hear it from
all sides of our mine. As if it were now (one does
not forget such moments!), I remember that the
blows sounded near the left side of the passage
and a little above it. The distance was less
than a sagene (7 feet), but more than an archine
(28 inches).</p>

<p>Though the worker was very careful in using his
pick, yet he scraped away the loose earth and stones
rather noisily.</p>

<p>This scraping sound was plainly audible through
the intervening rock, but it was thought very probably
that an enemy on the other side could not hear it.</p>

<p>When I had quite decided how attacker and
defender were situated with regard to each other, I
climbed out of the mine and reported the result
of my observations. Colonel Grigorenko and his
miners accepted my conclusions, and decided to
lay their charge. A report was made to the commandant
of the hill, who had himself heard the
enemy at work, and he personally exploded our mine,
which completely destroyed that of the Japanese,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and, bursting along the gallery, hurled planks, tools,
and men to destruction.</p>

<p>However, having once laid open part of the
caponier, which was now quite unprotected by earth,
the Japanese blew it up with dynamite and became
masters of part of the interior, and from this time
there was a continual struggle for the possession of
this place, which lasted for a very long time. Some
one who was actually there must, however, describe
what happened. I only know about it from what I
have heard, and cannot give any reliable information
except as to what I personally saw on a visit to
the fort after the Japanese had blown up the roof
of the gallery.</p>

<p>I do not now remember why I went to the fort
that day, but I think it was simply out of curiosity.
The roof of a large bomb-proof inside had then been
wrecked by an 11-inch shell, and I noticed the
amount of damage done. I saw the wooden wall
dividing the ruined part of the casemate from the
unharmed and habitable portion, near which General
Kondratenko and seven of General Gorbatovski’s
best officers were killed.</p>

<p>When I left the semi-caponier, it was thick with
smoke from our rifles, though it was possible to breathe
in it. Near the sand-bag wall dividing the portion
occupied by the Japanese from ours stood two riflemen,
who continued to fire through the embrasures
at the enemy hidden in the dark on the other side.
There was a huge heap of empty cartridge cases piled
up round them, reaching almost as high as their waists.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The enemy in my section worked away at his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
saps, and we continued firing at the sap-heads,
throwing grenades into them, and frequently making
sorties, the majority of which were most successful.
Many of the men who took part in these sorties
were deserving of, and recommended for St. George’s
Crosses; but General Fock did not credit the 5th
Regiment with any particular bravery, and kept back
the reward lists (ordering them to be curtailed
and combined on one general sheet), so that, when
eventually the fortress fell, they were probably all
lost, and many heroic deeds passed unrewarded.</p>

<p>Availing ourselves of this period of comparative
quiet, we varied occasionally the every-day
routine work by riding into the town, or visiting
other portions of our line of defences. However,
a drive into the town was no great treat, as it
was continually swept by fire, and once my horses
were nearly killed by a shell bursting just ahead
of them.</p>

<p>I generally went to see Colonel Grigorenko, but I
also visited, though rarely, the commandant (General
Smirnov) and General Stessel. We could always
have tea with them and hear the latest news about
everything.</p>

<p>It was most interesting to go to Golden Hill,
whence they were continually firing on the enemy’s
torpedo-boats, and where latterly an attack by
fire-ships was expected. The search-lights were kept
going all night, and if one of the Japanese ships
happened to cross the illuminated area, she fared
badly. All the shore batteries would open at once
a terrific fire on the unfortunate vessel, and the
sea round her would boil and spout columns of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
water thrown up by the falling shell. In the town
the firing sounded like thunder, and as the bombardment
nearly always continued at night, the
flash of the guns produced the effect of lightning;
indeed, when one heard the low, unceasing rumble
and crash, and saw the frequent flashes, it seemed
as if this were not the work of man’s hand, but
a grand natural phenomenon. But this display
cost us hundreds of precious shells which we were
unable to replace.</p>

<p>The Japanese kept a very keen look-out at sea,
and even Chinese junks found great difficulty in
slipping past them. Imagine our surprise and delight,
when one night a <i>steamer</i> came into Pigeon
Bay. The general conjecture was that it had
brought machine guns and shell.</p>

<p>We were told that the vessel had brought some
supplies, and that my wife had sent me a large
quantity of foodstuffs from Tientsin; but Major
Dostovalov, the officer in charge of stores and transport,
would not tell me what kind they were, or how
much there was of them. Everything that had been
brought was commandeered by the commissariat
staff, and several days passed without a word being
said about our presents.</p>

<p>So I went to Major Dostovalov and asked him
to let me have what had been sent me.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have got something for you,” he said,
“but I have not been able to send it to you
yet. If you like, I will give you five Westphalian
hams and we will consider everything square,
eh?”</p>

<p>I did not expect to get so much as that, I must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
confess, and my mouth watered at the thought of
the five hams.</p>

<p>“Rather,” I said. “I shall be quite satisfied.”</p>

<p>I received my five hams and returned home in
triumph.</p>

<p>The officers were even more pleased than I was,
and we demolished the hams with the greatest relish,
feeling very well disposed towards Major Dostovalov,
who had added as I went away: “I am sorry you
have come a bit late, Colonel, as I would have let
you have more, but I can’t now, as all I have left is
for the generals.”</p>

<p>I heard afterwards that my wife had sent me
twelve hams, some fruit, sausages, coffee, and so on—300
roubles’<a id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> worth altogether. So after deducting
the five hams I actually received, there was a good
deal left, all of which was snapped up by the senior
officers.</p>

<p>Though we were rather sore about it, and there
was a good deal of grumbling, yet we blamed Major
Dostovalov and our Chi-fu Consul (Tiddeman) even
more for not sending us some newspapers.</p>

<p class="noindent">By about November 23 the saps made by the Japanese
against the left flank of 203 Metre Hill had reached
nearly as far as the lower line of the wire entanglement,
but those in front were still very far off. We
thus concluded that there was no likelihood of an
attack on the hill yet awhile; and as to an attack on
the centre of our positions, in General Gorbatovski’s
section, we certainly anticipated none, since it would
be more advantageous for the Japanese, having
such vast superiority in numbers, to attack the
fortress along the whole of its front at the same
moment.</p>

<p>However, notwithstanding our deductions, we
noticed from our observation points that on November
23, 24, and 25 some unusual movement was being
carried out on the enemy’s side. Apparently new
troops were arriving. The same was observed from
our positions and batteries.</p>

<p>Troops were being sent across to 174 Metre Hill.
“They are meant for <i>us</i>,” we said to ourselves. The
bombardment of all our positions by heavy guns
became fiercer, and our left flank on 203 Metre Hill
suffered severely. The enemy made a trench extending
away to the right from his first sap, and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
from there he could very probably see into the
harbour we decided to make a sortie to destroy it.</p>

<p>On the 26th the bombardment of 203 Metre Hill
and of the central forts of our position became heavier
still, so that it became clear that an attack was
imminent, and we made preparations accordingly.
From this moment we kept our stormers, <i>i.e.</i> the
troops detailed to resist the assault, in the trenches.
Those suffering from scurvy were detailed for this
duty, and as it was very hard on men afflicted with
this disease to have to remain in the trenches, we used
to send them away to the rear, out of danger, where
they could bask in the sun. As soon as an attack was
anticipated, the order was sent down: “Stormers
to their posts!” upon which they had to leave their
place of concealment and climb up the hill into
the trenches.</p>

<p>A telephone message came through to the effect
that our centre was being attacked.<a id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>I went to Akasaka Yama, and found that the
earth-works on its left flank had been badly damaged
and the fortifications in front had been wrecked as
well. I recognized at once that, in spite of the
solidity of our works on 203 Metre Hill, they would
not protect our men from the destructive force of
the 11-inch shell.</p>

<p>On November 26 the enemy fired twenty-five
11-inch shells, eight 6-inch, 60 mines,<a id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and 300 shells
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>of small calibre. The redoubt on the left flank of
203 Metre Hill was much damaged.</p>

<p>From the right flank of 203 Metre Hill we watched
a terrific bombardment directed against Forts Erh-lung
and Sung-shu. We heard the rattle of rifle fire
from all sides, but I saw no signs of an assault. On
returning to the staff headquarters, I heard the good
news that all the attacks had been repulsed with
enormous losses to the enemy. This news I immediately
telephoned to all our hills, and ordered the
garrisons to be prepared for attack. In order to
further secure our line from being broken through,
I called up the non-combatant companies<a id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> of the
5th, 13th, and 28th Regiments, and with them occupied
a second line of defence.</p>

<p>The enemy literally swept 203 Metre and the other
hills with fire. From various signs on November 26, we
concluded that the Japanese were preparing to attack
my front, so I moved up the reserve, and gave orders
for all to be ready to meet the impending assault.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 27th,<a id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> 203 Metre Hill
resembled a volcano in eruption. Apparently the
enemy wished to sweep it off the face of the earth
with his shells. Telephone messages were received
from the commandant every minute, reporting the
fearful damage done by the 11-inch projectiles.</p>

<p>Finally, by about 8 a.m., all the telephones were
out of action, and at about 9 a.m. an orderly
galloped up and reported that the hill was in the
hands of the Japanese. This was apparently a mistake,
as we could see no signs of our retirement from
the hill, and everything there appeared to be as
before. As a matter of fact, the works on the hill
had been almost completely wrecked, but the losses
had been small, as only sentries and small reliefs
were in the trenches.</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. the Japanese attacked, but were repulsed.
The commandant, however, sent for reinforcements
and more officers, of whom very few were left. I
sent up some reinforcements, and with them Naval
Ensign Deitchman, already known to us as an
exceedingly brave officer, whom, with the approval
of Colonel Irman, I appointed orderly officer to
the commandant.</p>

<p>It was already dark when Deitchman reached the
hill, and on his arrival he found that all was not well.
It transpired that the attack had not been entirely
beaten back, and that a small body of Japanese
was lodged in a blindage near the central battery,
there awaiting reinforcements. The commandant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>immediately summoned a council of war, which at
once decided to drive the Japanese out of this stronghold.
Acting Ensign Yermakov, being thoroughly
acquainted with the positions of all the fortifications,
was detailed to organize the counter-attack. He
formed three groups of volunteers with which to
carry out his plans. The first, under Fleet Ensign
Morosov, was to attack the Japanese from the right
flank; the second, under an officer whose name I
have not learned, was to do the same from the left
flank; and the third, under Deitchman, was to rush
the enemy from the front. On the signal being
given, all the columns made a rush on the blindage,
but Ensign Deitchman was shot in the head and
killed on the spot. However, grenades were thrown
into the blindage and annihilated the Japanese.
Fleet Ensign Morosov was the first to rush in.</p>

<p>That day the enemy discharged thirty 11-inch,
about three hundred 6-inch, and a great number of
shell of smaller calibre at 203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>At daybreak on November 28 the Japanese continued
to bombard the hill, and destroyed everything
that had been repaired during the night. From
early morning the firing increased, and eventually
the Japanese moved to the attack.</p>

<p>By midday they had completely wrecked the
trenches on the hill with their shells, and as General
Kondratenko had come to the staff headquarters,
I prepared to go to 203 Metre Hill personally to
direct affairs. During the day we repulsed two
attacks and I sent up all my reserves in support—the
6th Company of sailors and the non-combatant
companies of the 14th and 16th Regiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of officers of various corps had collected
at headquarters, all eagerly watching the course of
the fighting on 203 Metre Hill through their
glasses.</p>

<p>At 4.30 p.m. on the 28th the Japanese again attacked
the ill-fated hill. Our decimated remnant
was cut to pieces, and the enemy captured both
the upper breastworks.<a id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>On Akasaka Yama also things were not going
well, and at about 2 p.m. I sent up the 7th Company
of the 27th Regiment, which had only just arrived.</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. I mounted my horse and rode to 203
Metre Hill. Father Vasili gave me a small silver
crucifix as a charm, which I put on.</p>

<p>I reached the foot of the hill. In the ravine near
the dressing station was a countless crowd of wounded
and unwounded men. The rear slopes of the hill
were covered with men lying in different postures,
wounded men who had died on their way back.
The reserve company was standing under arms, the
men flattening themselves close up against the cliff,
while shells were exploding all around. The top of
the hill was wreathed in smoke from the bursting
of every kind of projectile.</p>

<p>Having left my horse near the dressing station,
and called up all the unwounded men who were
taking shelter under the hill, I started to climb up,
and reached the top of the road without a scratch.</p>

<p>Here a truly awful scene of ruin met my eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>The light plank bomb-proofs, which were built out
from the steep side of the cutting along which the
road ran, were almost all destroyed and were choked
with mangled bodies and torn fragments of human
limbs. The whole road was simply blocked with
broken beams and dead bodies.</p>

<p>Stepping over all this, and slipping about on
the planks, which were saturated with blood, I
reached the telephone bomb-proof, which had by
some marvel been left untouched. Here I found
the commandant and several officers, all apparently
at a loss as to what action to take.</p>

BLINDAGE COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY A 11-INCH SHELL.</p>
    <p class="x-small left">p. 236]</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In a few words the commandant explained the
situation to me. It was even worse than I had anticipated,
and something had to be done instantly.</p>

<p>All the reserves had been used up, so we formed
one out of the men I had brought with me. Although
both breastworks were in the hands of the
Japanese, our men were holding on like grim death
to the ground in rear of them, the blindages, narrow
passages, and communication trenches. The whole
of the space between the two breastworks was still
in our possession. The lower, circular trench was
almost completely wrecked, but our men were still
firmly lodged in the few untouched parts of it. It
thus seemed to me that we must drive out the Japanese
by one well-directed blow, and that, moreover,
this would not be a difficult matter.</p>

<p>In order to put my plan into execution, I formed
the men I had brought with me into one command,
had hand grenades served out to each man,
and, having given them a short harangue, sent them
off, some against the left breastwork, and some against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the right. Seeing that all was not yet lost, and
led by young officers, the gallant fellows rushed
upon the works with a wild cheer. This was about
7 p.m.</p>

<p>The left one was taken in a single rush. The other
did not fall at once, and the men came to a standstill
before it, but again rushed forward on their own
initiative and drove the enemy out, many officers,
including Lieutenant Yermakov, witnessing their
action. Hand grenades were freely used and once
again proved themselves invaluable.</p>

<p>I immediately sent a report to General Stessel and
General Kondratenko. The former had given orders
to me personally to let him know by telephone all
that happened on 203 Metre Hill, and I now received
a message of congratulation from him. As soon
as the Japanese had been driven out of the breastworks,
the enemy’s artillery fire became fiercer, and
was directed mainly on the left flank of the circular
trench and on the breastwork above it.</p>

<p>In order not to expose needlessly those of
my men who were holding the now completely
wrecked lower line of trenches, I ordered them to
make their way round to the upper road at the rear,
and form the reserve. We abandoned the ruined
circular trench, with the exception of its left flank,
but the enemy, unaware of this, continued to
complete its destruction, expending thousands of
shell.</p>

<p>I sent for sand-bags and reinforcements to make
good at once the damage done to the trenches and
breastworks on the top of the hill. A few hours
later two companies of sailors and a two-wheeled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
cart with hand grenades arrived. I placed the
sailors in the reserve dug-outs (deep ditches—one
above and one below the lower road), which were
practically immune from fire.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Fenster, a sapper, arrived on the hill,
and proposed to repair the trenches and the breastworks
during the night. The north face of the left
breastwork, and the bomb-proof in it, were so ruined,
that I could not climb across them to its western
face, and the left end of the trench connecting the
breastwork was levelled to the ground, but the rear
face of the work remained intact.</p>

<p>It was imperative that all this damage should be
at once repaired with sand-bags, provided there
was no attack meanwhile.</p>

<p>All the enemy’s trenches round the hill were full
of Japanese.</p>

<p>Night was falling on November 28, when hand
grenades began to burst in the left breastwork,
and a soldier ran up with the report that the Japanese
were attacking. We rushed out on to the road where
the reserves were. The communication passages
from all the fortifications on the hill met there, and
there was also a hollow in the ground, used as a
dressing station. But the explosions of hand grenades
suddenly ceased and all grew quiet, save for the roar
of the cannon; our hand grenades seem to have driven
the Japanese back into their trenches. But how
would it be at dead of night when it was impossible
to see how far off the enemy was? I was afraid
there would be a panic. In repulsing the enemy’s
attack so easily, we had had great assistance from the
detachments led by Lieutenants Siromiatnikov and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Nejentsev which had taken the enemy in rear from
the direction of Major Soloveiev’s position.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>That night (November 28) was a dark one, and
everything was apparently quiet since the last attack,
only the occasional roar of an exploding hand grenade
breaking the stillness. I could not sleep all night,
but kept sending out orderlies in all directions, and
conversing with the staff over the telephone wires.
Every one wanted to know what was happening
on the hill. During the night several two-wheeled
carts came up with hand grenades, which I ordered
to be stored in the bomb-proofs near the dressing
station.</p>

<p>At about 4 a.m. gun fire again commenced, and
the stream of wounded began to come down from
the crest to the foot of the hill and beyond.</p>

<p>The Japanese had made many vain attacks, and
we could live through everything but heavy gun fire.
But the moral effect had to be considered; our men
were accustomed to the shells and to heavy losses,
and to these they had become quite indifferent, but
the infantry attacks upset their nerves. And now
one of them was in progress: hand grenades were
bursting in the left breastwork, and an orderly ran
up asking for reinforcements, officers, and hand
grenades. Grenades then began to burst on the right
breastwork, and our men there also sent for a supply.
I sent up all they required, and asked Colonel Irman
to send me officers from the staff. In response
Captain Bielozerov was sent to me. Serious work
was at hand, for the roll of rifle fire broke out, foretelling
an impending attack. I ordered the company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
at the foot of the hill to come up to the upper road,
and asked for yet another company by telephone.
The reply came that there was none available. I
then telephoned for our 5th Company to leave its
lines on Division Hill near Fort Yi-tzu Shan, to
which it had only just returned, and to come up
at once to 203 Metre Hill. The firing and bursting
of grenades increased, while the bombardment ceased—truly
a bad sign.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Indeed, our men were already flying out of the
left breastwork. I brought up my company of
sailors, sent it to meet the fugitives, and shouted
myself hoarse, “Stop, stop! reinforcements!” Nevertheless,
they would not stop, and the sailors also
wavered and came to a standstill. There was a
good deal of confusion, and what I cried out, what
I actually did, I do not now quite remember. It
seems, however, I succeeded in rallying the men,
for those of my own regiment began to gather round
me; and when I found that I was at the head of a
considerable number of men I led them against the
left breastwork. Riflemen and sailors rushed forward
and swarmed on to the work with Captain Bielozerov,
who was the first in. Much the same happened as
regards the breastwork on the right, but the state
of affairs was not quite so bad there, as no panic
had occurred, and they had simply sent me word
that the Japanese had taken it, but that our men
were still holding the rear rampart. With the other
officers I led a detachment of sailors up through the
communication passages into the work. The Japanese
made a poor resistance, and in a few minutes we
had captured the place at the point of the bayonet.
I sent off a long written report, shell fire having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
destroyed the telephone wires, which, however, our
sappers connected up again within ten minutes.</p>

<p>Here I should like to say a word or two about our
sappers. I had only very few of them, either on 203
Metre Hill, or in my section of defence, but they
were all fearless and beyond reproach. Notwithstanding
constant danger, they worked with perfect
unconcern. Many of them were placed <i>hors de
combat</i>. One shell fell into a bomb-proof where
they were working and severely wounded eight of
them, in spite of which the energy and daring of
those left were in no way diminished. They were
always seeking opportunities to make themselves
useful, and, indeed, their services to their country
and their Tsar had a great effect on the soldiers with
whom they came in contact.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Having taken command on 203 Metre Hill, I could
not, of course, exercise control over the other defended
hills, so Colonel Irman undertook this duty.
Being thus in ignorance of what was going on beyond
203 Metre Hill, I felt very uneasy about Akasaka
Yama, which the enemy was again attacking. Sapping
up as far as the ravine in front of 203 Metre
Hill, the Japanese had driven one sap-head from this
ravine straight towards the foot of Akasaka Yama,
then, stopping work about 70 feet from it, they had
run across in groups to a small stretch of dead
ground under the cliff facing Namako Yama and had
begun to do something there, as we could plainly
see. Although I had had abattis constructed above
this cliff, and our trench ran along behind the abattis,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
this point was the most vulnerable in the whole of
the defences of Akasaka Yama, and my fears were
realized, for the enemy chose this very point for his
attack.</p>

<p>I was the more concerned about Akasaka Yama
because, if it fell into the hands of the enemy, communication
with 203 Metre Hill from the rear would
be interrupted, the latter could then be enfiladed
from all sides, and it would become impossible to
hold it any longer. On the other hand, as long as
Akasaka Yama remained ours, it gave strong support
to 203 Metre Hill and prevented the enemy from
attacking it from the front and right flank. The
Japanese made one attempt to do this and suffered
very severely, several hundreds of men falling on
the northern slopes of 203 Metre Hill under the fire
of the rifles and machine guns on Akasaka Yama.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Having received a severe check, the enemy ceased
attacking, but continued to work at his parallels and
to make a zigzag to the right. This was very serious
for us, as it brought the Japanese up to a point on
the hill from which they could observe the fall of
their shell within the harbour area. Without doubt,
we should have to make a sortie in force.</p>

<p>By hurling at least three companies on the enemy
in the night, we could drive him out of his parallel
and destroy it. The casualties would be heavy, but
the success gained would be large in proportion.
As it was, we were only just able to hold the hill,
and our losses were severe. We could only get
reinforcements with the greatest difficulty, as they
were wanted for General Gorbatovski’s section,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
which was also being attacked. But it was impossible
to hold the hill without reserves; either
several companies a day would have to be sacrificed,
or else the hill abandoned.</p>

<p>The fearful effect of the 11-inch shell made us think
it expedient to dig caves out of the hill-sides to give
the men cover, and we began to do so, but it was
then too late. Those we had time to make were
only large enough to shelter a few men.</p>

<p>Evening was already drawing in on November 29.
The bombardment slackened (the Japanese must
have run out of ammunition), and curls of smoke
were to be seen in places covered from fire under
the hill, where the men were making fires for their
tea. Everything seemed to point to the day ending
quietly, and I felt quite satisfied, not having the
least suspicion of what a trick the sailors in the left
breastwork were going to play upon me. I had sent
my orderly there (I do not remember what for); ten
minutes later he came running back to me and
reported that there was not a single man in the
breastwork—it was absolutely empty.</p>

<p>“But where are the sailors?” I cried.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir! They must have gone away.”</p>

<p>I immediately sent for the naval officers and
ordered them to find their men and send them back
to their post, and in the meantime I sent to the
breastwork all the men near me—about ten riflemen
and scouts, who were acting as my orderlies.</p>

<p>I always kept near me a few men thoroughly
acquainted with the fortifications on the hill. This
was essential, as a man who did not know every
feature might very easily lose himself in the labyrinth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of trenches and communication passages, and thus
fail to take my orders to those for whom they
were intended.</p>

<p>An hour later the sailors were all collected, and I
only forgave them their foolish action in consideration
of their splendid previous attack, and the way
they had driven the Japanese out of the breastwork.
I ordered the naval officers to be always with their
men and not to stay in the bomb-proofs, reminding
them that this was the second time the sailors had
been guilty of leaving their post.</p>

<p>Night had already fallen—for me always a trying
time, as it is impossible to exercise effective control
in the darkness—and the only thing I could do was
to walk about the hill and encourage my men by
talking to them. But my voice had almost entirely
gone, from constantly shouting in the daytime.</p>

<p>When it had got quite dark, some sappers arrived,
bringing sand-bags. Reinforcements—two companies—also
came up. I decided to let those actually
in the fighting line sleep, and to make those who had
just arrived work; but what sleep and what work
were possible under a hail of every kind of shell?
We had available for night work, besides Lieutenant
Fenster and Acting Ensign Yermakov, Lieutenant
Reinbott of the Fortress Mining Company. Though
I was really dog-tired those last two days, still I did
not feel as if I wanted either to eat or sleep.</p>

<p>As soon as day broke on the 30th, the firing
increased in volume, and we witnessed the utter
destruction of the right face of the left breastwork
by the agency of several well-aimed 11-inch projectiles.
Luckily, the enemy failed to do much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
damage to the side which was open to his constant
attacks, but the inner ditch was completely filled
with dead bodies, both of our own men and the
Japanese, which we were unable to remove. It was
impossible to do so, as in the daytime this face of
the work was swept by shrapnel from the flank
and rear, and at night our men there were always
on the “qui vive” for an attack, and could not
leave the cover of the breastwork; besides which a
great many men would be needed to carry away
the dead, and we had no one to spare.</p>

<p>At 8 a.m. the Japanese suddenly attacked the
left breastwork, captured the front portion, and
raised their flag. The sight of this flag always filled
our men with fury. I knew this, and, pointing
to it, shouted to the reserve: “Go and take it
down, my lads!” and, like one man, our sailors
rushed into the work. I led them for some distance,
and a moment after there was no sign of the
Japanese or their flag to be seen. Twice more the
hostile flag made its appearance on top of the
hill, but each time it was torn down by my handful
of reserves.</p>

<p>At about 11 a.m., or a little earlier, I was in the
telephone bomb-proof with the commandant, Major
Stempnevski, Acting Ensign Yermakov, and several
naval officers. Suddenly we heard shouts and irregular
rifle firing. I rushed out on to the road,
and this is what I saw. Our men were in full flight
from the centre of the hill and the left flank, and
many of them were simply tumbling head over heels
in their hurry to get away. Not far from the bomb-proof
I had to jump over the body of a Japanese,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
apparently just killed. I began to shout “Stop,
stop!” and in order to enforce my words I drew
my sword and hit one after another (with the flat,
of course), Lieutenant Podgourski and the other
officers with me doing the same. The men heeded
my voice, and, stopping where they were, opened
a straggling fire on the top of the hill. I was then
anxious to go to the reserve, as, owing to the firing,
my voice could not carry so far, but fearing that
my men might follow after me, I did not myself
go back, but sent Yermakov.</p>

<p>By this time we could see Japanese soldiers
springing up on to the top, and they began at once
to fire along the road. At the same moment several
dozen men scrambled up to me from below, and,
standing round me, began to fire and shout hoarsely
“Hurrah!” In the midst of all this noise and
firing I felt that matters had passed beyond my
control, while all the time the number of the Japanese
on the hill was growing and growing. Luckily, the
reserves were not more than 10 paces from me now,
and I already saw Yermakov and Fenster ahead of
me; they both had rifles. The only thing to be done
now was to make a rush with the new-comers
and the men I had round me, and this we did.
Those who had retreated, finding they were reinforced,
threw themselves on the Japanese with a
deafening shout, and we were once again masters
of the hill.</p>

<p>Had not the reserve come up at the critical
moment, we should have been driven off the hill,
and then, indeed, it would have been impossible
to retake it, as the Japanese were being strongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
reinforced. Once on the summit again it was quite
easy for us to throw down hand grenades. They
rolled down and caused fearful havoc among the
retreating enemy. Our rifles and artillery, which
both opened a heavy fire on the foot of the hill and
the neighbouring ravines, were a helpful addition to
the grenades. In less than ten minutes the Japanese
had disappeared into their trenches, and once more
we breathed freely.</p>

<p>Without waiting for the enemy’s guns to open
fire, I took my men back into the reserve bomb-proofs;
and it was fortunate I did so, as almost
immediately shells began to burst over the top,
covering it with a cloud of poisonous black smoke.
Once again our slightly and badly wounded men
began to hobble, or be carried, away from the summit.</p>

<p>It was a terrible sight; still it was wonderful to
behold how these heroes died fearlessly or suffered
without complaint.</p>

<p>The number of corpses on the road rapidly increased,
and in consequence it was difficult to
breathe, from the offensive smell.</p>

<p>The time had certainly come to ask for men to
collect the dead.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>I sent a report of all that had taken place, and
then went with the commandant and some other
officers to our observation position near the dressing
station, where there was an enormous number of
wounded, keeping the surgeons hard at work.</p>

<p>I remember as if it were to-day that I had turned
with my face to the rear and was looking at the
crowd of men who were standing near the lower
dressing station, and wondering where they all came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
from. Suddenly there was a fearful explosion, and
I was thrown with terrific force to the ground. The
shock was so great, that for a time I was stunned.
When I at last got up, scattering the earth which
covered me, there in front was a great pile of bodies,
and beneath them all lay the commandant, Major
Stempnevski. All were motionless, but ghastly
gasping sounds and heartrending groans filled the
air. I turned round. At my feet were several
dead, and on them, face downwards, lay Acting
Ensign Reishetov and the sergeant-major of the 2nd
Company, while a young naval mechanic was sitting
on the ground, crying aloud with pain and clutching
with both hands his left side. Others, like myself,
were now coming to themselves, and we began to
separate the dead from the wounded. An assistant-surgeon
ran up to the young mechanic and carried
him down, and we put Major Stempnevski into
the splinter-proof. He was conscious. Blood was
pouring from his head and face.</p>

<p>“Where are you hurt, Stanislav Youlianovitch?”
I said to him; and he replied: “My back is injured,
and I can’t breathe.”</p>

<p>“They will take you down below,” I said.</p>

<p>“No, no; wait till the firing has slackened.”</p>

<p>So I left him lying in the splinter-proof. Probably
the shell had struck the cliff near which we were
standing, but I, luckily, was a little farther off, and
had only received a bad blow on the right shoulder.
An hour later they carried our gallant commandant
away to the lower dressing station, and I felt myself
very much alone.</p>

<p>I reported what had happened, and asked for one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of the other officers to be sent up to take the place of
the commandant. Although the Japanese had had
more than one good lesson from us, they were not
satisfied, and here and there came out of their trenches
in considerable numbers, but were immediately
driven back again by rifle and machine-gun fire
from 203 Metre Hill and Akasaka Yama. However,
with demoniacal persistence, they twice crawled
through our wire entanglements, and on the left
flank even got as far as the breastwork, but, decimated
by hand grenades, they broke and fled,
strewing the slopes of the hill with their dead.</p>

<p>This was a red-letter day, both for us and for
the Japanese. At about 8 p.m. I had just gone
up to a bomb-proof to have some food, when I
heard shouts of “Hurrah!” and renewed bomb explosions,
which told me of yet another attack. I
rushed out of the bomb-proof, and saw our sailors
and riflemen crowding on the parapet near the gorge
of the breastwork, and throwing hand grenades
down into it. This looked bad, as the Japanese must
have driven them out of the work. I told the other
officers to place the few dozen men who were on
the road behind the stones and boulders near the
breastwork, so as to prevent the enemy from seizing
the road, and to mark at the same time the extreme
point beyond which our men must not on any account
retreat.</p>

<p>I immediately sent for the reserve, which consisted
at that time of our 1st Scout Detachment.
It was not an easy matter to climb such a hill as
203 Metre, nor could it be done in a moment, so a
considerable time elapsed before Captain Vaseeliev<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
came up with his men. The handful defending the
gorge of the breastwork above had dwindled away
considerably, and I reported that the Japanese had
got as far as the left flank of the connecting trench,
now completely wrecked, and had established themselves
there. But apparently they had not secured
a very firm foothold, and the interior of the work
was unoccupied. That meant that our men, surprised
by the suddenness of the attack, had evacuated
the work, the front face of which had been
captured by the enemy. I shouted to the defenders
ordering them not to retreat another step, but to
hold on for all they were worth, as I was coming
immediately with the scouts to their support. An
officer, who had remained in the bomb-proof in the
centre of the work, sent an orderly to tell me that
the enemy had occupied the parapet, but were afraid
to come down into the work. Unfortunately, I was
not able to find out this officer’s name.</p>

<p>Having told Captain Vaseeliev where to make
his attack, and the necessary dispositions being
made, I addressed the men briefly, and then
set out with them against the point which I had
decided to attack—the right flank of the left
breastwork, and the left flank of the connecting
trench. Of course, the gallant fellows outstripped
me, and the rush of these men, together with
the few left who had defended the gorge of the
breastwork, and some other riflemen who appeared
from somewhere on the right, drove the
Japanese out of their trenches. It does not take
long to tell this, but it was not done quite so
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The detachment under Captain Vaseeliev, and
all those who rushed forward with him, for a long
time kept on shouting “Hurrah!” firing, and throwing
hand grenades. The Japanese on the parapet made
a stubborn resistance. Together with some other
officers I remained in the gorge of the breastwork,
and heard our men shouting “Hurrah!” and saw
them running along the narrow trenches to the front
face, which the Japanese still held. Then two explosions
were heard, followed by others, and the
next moment our men were on the parapet. Dozens
of hand grenades were hurled after the retreating
enemy, so that the very hill seemed to quiver from
their violent explosions. I immediately went down
to the road to give orders that all those who had
descended the hill should be brought up at once.
Whenever the alarm went a fair number of men
were always there.</p>

<p>But I had anticipated matters, for a whole
company—about a hundred men—were coming up
the hill towards me, sailors and riflemen, led by
their field-cornet, who received the St. George’s
Cross from me on the spot. This was a pleasant
surprise for him; but a disagreeable one was
awaiting me.</p>

<p>Feeling that the hill was now safe again, I was
standing on the road in the centre of my positions,
when Captain Vaseeliev came quickly up to me
and reported: “I am badly wounded, Colonel, and
I can’t command any longer. Allow me to go down
to the dressing station.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said. “From my heart I wish
you rapid recovery. The Cross of St. George is yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment had lost yet another gallant officer,
but God grant! not for ever.</p>

<p>Everything being now quiet on the hill, I sent a
report to Colonel Irman and desired him to ask General
Kondratenko to give me permission to leave the hill
to get some rest and have my wound dressed. I
also asked for sand-bags and men to repair damages.
Everything I asked for was sent up, and three engineer
officers also arrived. There was no need to
show them where the work was to be done, and I
had just sat down to rest—it was now about midnight—when
I saw Colonel Irman and my adjutant,
Lieutenant Kostoushko-Valeejinitch, arriving. Having
made a full report and explained the present
situation, I took them into the commandant’s
bomb-proof, where Colonel Irman at once expressed
the wish to inspect the hill and thank the men for
repelling the attacks.</p>

<p>He disappeared into the trench with Lieutenant
Kostoushko, and I lay down to rest, as I was
worn out through want of sleep. Loud talking in
the bomb-proof awoke me. Opening my eyes I
saw a crowd of naval officers, some of them old
friends, but some new arrivals, who had been sent
to the hill from headquarters.</p>

<p>Here I may mention that the naval detachments
were frequently commanded by heads of the Naval
Department or by ensigns of the fleet. Many of
these were splendid fellows, among whom Losev
and Morosov were particularly distinguished for
their unsurpassed bravery.</p>

<p>I had eaten hardly anything for four days, and
had scarcely slept.</p>

<p class="hang small">The fighting on December 1—Reconnoitring at night—The “ideal
officer”—The attacks on 203 Metre Hill on December 4—Events
on Akasaka Yama from November 27 to December 4.</p>

<p class="noindent">December 1 ran its course in the usual way, until
it had grown dark, when something rather serious
occurred. Owing to the constant alarms, and my
fears for the safety of the hill, I could not think of
eating, but, taking advantage of a period of comparative
quiet, and hoping that the Japanese would
take some time to recover from the severe lesson
they had had, I had gone out into the open air (it
was fearfully close in the bomb-proof) and was
sitting on the slope of the parapet, when suddenly
the alarm was raised. Rifle firing broke out, accompanied
by the roar of bursting hand grenades.
I sprang to my feet and saw that our men were
flying out of the left breastwork—fortunately, however,
only a few of them as yet. Midshipman
Soimonov was there with the sailors.</p>

<p>“What’s all this about?” I shouted.</p>

<p>“The hand grenades were too much for us. Every
one has gone, and the Japanese have captured our
work.”</p>

<p>“You fools!” I yelled after them. “You have been
asleep again. Get back at once and tell Midshipman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Soimonov that I order him to turn the Japanese
out again.”</p>

<p>Upon this, the sailors turned and ran past me.
Ten minutes afterwards there was a splutter of firing
from the left breastwork, next a loud “Hurrah!”
and then, a moment afterwards, silence. An orderly
from Midshipman Soimonov ran up to me and reported
that they had regained the trench, but that
the Japanese were still in possession of the work
itself, from which I concluded that the sailors alone
were numerically too weak to retake the place.</p>

<p>I sent a telegram to the staff, “Send me one fresh
company,” but probably there were none available,
as I did not even get a reply. Everything was
now quiet on the top of the hill. I was at a loss
what to do under these trying circumstances. At
about 2 a.m. I received a message: “The non-combatant
company of the 12th Regiment is coming
up under Sergeant-Major Kournosov. Organize a
counter-attack at once and drive out the Japanese.”</p>

<div class="center-img-landscape" id="image_Page_254">

    <p class="x-small left">p. 254]</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Before very long these reinforcements arrived.
Taking in addition a small body of men found at
the foot of the hill, I myself showed them the way
(no one else knew the disposition of the fortifications
so well), and then went round with Kournosov and
from all sides inspected the left breastwork.</p>

<p>The Japanese in it were keeping very quiet.<a id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> I
posted my men, appointed leaders for each column
(one was to attack from the rear, and one from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
right flank), and indicated to them their points of
attack. On a given signal both columns were to
make their attack simultaneously. Before, however,
the signal had been given, the men suddenly began
to fire and shout “Hurrah!” There was such a
medley of noises, that it was impossible to make one’s
voice heard, and, owing to the darkness, personal
example was out of the question. For a long time
there was much intermittent firing and disorderly
shouting, and then at last all grew quiet again for a
brief space, only to be followed by renewed shouting
and firing a few seconds afterwards.</p>

<p>“Well,” I thought to myself, “we shall never do
anything with these non-combatants,” and the darkness
and maze of trenches over the scene of action
combined to make all attempts at control useless.
I decided to wait till dawn, and sent a report to
that effect.</p>

<p>Everything grew quiet again, so Soimonov came
up and reported that the riflemen had started firing
and shouting, and that his sailors had rushed upon
the parapet, but were met by shots. It was quite
dark, and the men had thrown themselves down on
the slope of the parapet and would not advance any
farther. They thought there were a lot of Japanese
in the work, and some one could be seen smoking
just inside the entrance to the bomb-proof.</p>

<p>“Why do you think that there are a lot of Japanese
in the breastwork?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure, how many there are,
but I personally think that there cannot be very many,
as their volley was a scattered one; but our men
lost confidence owing to the darkness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take some grenades and throw them into the
work,” I said, and I sent about a hundred grenades
up to them.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the grenades burst in the work,
and then all was silent again. This silence lasted
a long time. I could stand the suspense no longer,
so sent an officer to Soimonov to find out what was
happening.</p>

<p>About two hours afterwards, the officer returned
and reported that he had been all round the work
along the lower line of trenches and had not met a
soul. He had then crawled into an embrasure and
looked into the work, where nothing was to be seen
but a heap of smouldering planks and beams, with
the charred head of a man amongst them. Our men
had then immediately reoccupied the breastwork.</p>

<p>Apparently, the Japanese had been driven out
by our hand grenades and the place was empty. I
at once sent a report of what had occurred, and
replaced the sailors by a company of rifles which had
just arrived.</p>

<p>I unfortunately forgot the name of the plucky
young officer who had climbed into the breastwork,
but it is not too late for him to come forward now,
and, if he does, he will certainly receive the St.
George’s Cross.</p>

<p>My back began to ache a good deal with a kind
of burning sensation. All the time I had not undressed
to see if my wound from the bursting shell
was serious or not, and, besides this, I was absolutely
worn out. I felt I ought to try and regain
my strength, and eagerly awaited a reply to my
request for permission to leave the hill to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
my wound examined and properly dressed. Sanction
was at length given, and Second-Lieutenant Organov
was sent to take my place; but he told me before
I left, that, as he knew nothing whatever about
the fortifications on the hill and their disposition,
he could not, therefore, hope to be an efficient commandant,
and begged me to come back as soon as
possible. I promised to return the following morning,
and then went off to the staff headquarters.</p>

<p>Dr. Theodore S. Troitski examined me, and found
a small punctured wound from a splinter, which
had been driven some distance into my back, and also
a large blue bruise. When my servant, Peter Ravinski,
shook out my grey wool-lined jacket, quite a quantity
of small splinters fell out. The thick wadding and
cloth had prevented them from penetrating, and
they had lodged in the lining. Only one—probably
larger than the others—had gone right through
and caused the wound. After a short conversation
with General Kondratenko, I lay down
to sleep.</p>

<p>The following day (December 2) the senior doctor
in the fortress came to the staff quarters in the morning
and had me taken to Field Hospital No. 9,
where Dr. Krjivetz operated, but failed to remove
the splinter. He said that to look for it would involve
tearing open the wound, and as the splinter was very
small, judging by the puncture, he thought it better
to leave it for the present.</p>

<p>After the operation I returned to the staff. General
Kondratenko, who was already there, seemed to be
in a very uneasy frame of mind.</p>

<p>“They have already been asking for you on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
hill. All is not well up there, and the commandant
seems very anxious. Please go as soon
as ever you can, Nikolai Alexandrovitch.”</p>

<p>I at once ordered my horse and rode off.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Apparently everything was quiet on the hill, and
there were no signs of disorder. When I had reached
the foot of the hill, I found a crowd of men of various
units and corps, which Captain Prince Nikoladtse
had collected and was trying to organize. Having
wished the men “Good morning,”<a id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> I began to
climb the hill.</p>

<p>The firing was very desultory, and I reached the
road in rear without mishap. The commandant
met me with undisguised pleasure and reported that
everything was all right.</p>

<p>“Why have you been so alarmed?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I were lost in a forest, sir: I
don’t know the officers, or the men, or the place.
Nobody slept last night,” answered the young commandant,
evidently very much concerned at his
helpless plight.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, things could not have been
better. Every one was at his post. Several detachments
of sailors had arrived, that under Lieutenant
Lavrov being composed of a really splendid lot of
men. All the sailors were in the very best of spirits,
like Lavrov himself. He at once came and reported
to me that his men were ready for anything. These
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>men, who had originally constituted a balloon section,
had made a balloon, but, as there was no means of
producing hydrogen, it could not be made to rise.
How useful it might have been to us!</p>

<p>“If you call for volunteers,” said the Lieutenant,
“my fellows will respond to a man.” And he spoke
the truth.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, wishing to reconnoitre the
empty lower trench and the Japanese trenches in front
of the hill, I called for volunteers, whereupon every
man in the detachment stepped forward. Then they
drew lots, and three men, delighted with their good
fortune, came into the commandant’s bomb-proof;
they were Quarter-Master (artificer) Yakov Artouk,
and two 1st class A.B.’s—Ivan Nefedov and Theodore
Pilshchikov. One of them especially, a beardless boy,
impressed me by his obvious joyousness. I explained
to them what they had to do and sent them off.</p>

<p>Everything was now quiet. About ten officers
had collected in the bomb-proof. We discussed
what was to be done to protect our road in rear
(where we always had a number of men) from the
direct fire of a battery which the Japanese had placed
near the village of Shui-shih-ying.<a id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Eventually we
came to the conclusion that the only way to effect
this was by destroying it with the guns from the forts.</p>

<p>I immediately sent to General Kondratenko
asking that this might be done. I gave orders
that no one was to leave the trenches except on
duty. Then we decided to make traverses in order
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>to give some sort of cover to those who had to be
on the road. The men usually left the trenches
for water or hand grenades, of which we required a
very large number, and, thank God! Lieutenant
Melik-Porsadanov and Midshipman Vlassev kept us
regularly supplied with them.<a id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>As I had not had sufficient rest at the staff
headquarters, by this time I felt an overpowering
drowsiness, so lay down on a mattress and fell
soundly asleep.</p>

<p>At 2 a.m. I was awakened. The sailors who had
been sent to reconnoitre had returned unharmed, and
reported that they had gone to the farther Japanese
trench. There they had found only one sentry,
whom they had killed, but not a single Japanese
was in any of the trenches (of which there were many)
in front of the hill. Our ruined circular trench was
also deserted, but it was impossible to walk in it,
as it was quite full of earth, stones, and splinters of
wood and iron.</p>

<p>I congratulated the men and awarded them crosses
(General Kondratenko had supplied several to be
given on the spot to those who should distinguish
themselves). This method of prompt reward made
a deep impression on every one.</p>

<p>I then sent three more volunteers to find out
where the Japanese were on the left of the hill, those
selected being Bereznouk, 1st class A.B., Semen
Boudarev (he had a mother and wife), and Kholodenko,
also a 1st class A.B.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>
<p>I had reason to think that our round trench on the
left, which we had evacuated, was still unoccupied
by the Japanese. If this were the case it was
essential to occupy it as far as possible, as it was
an excellent <i>point d’appui</i> from which to make
sorties against the enemy’s sap-head.</p>

<p>For a long time we awaited the return of our
gallant three, but there was no sign of them.</p>

<p>Day broke (December 3). On the left flank hand
grenades were bursting, accompanied by the roar of
11-inch shells. Many of the latter fell over the
crest near the telephone shelter; some did not burst
at all, but, striking the earth, slowly ricocheted
away towards False Hill, turning over and over in
their flight. It was a striking display, and the
soldiers watched it with much interest, joking about
the bad laying of the Japanese gunners.</p>

<p>A non-combatant detachment (I do not remember
of which regiment), under a quarter-master, came up
to make good our losses of the preceding day. The
men were placed in the trenches allotted to the
reserves, and the officer stood looking at the road,
and the piles of dead lying on it. I suggested to
him that he should sit in the trench or stand close
up under the almost perpendicular bank of the road.
But the young fellow said he was not afraid of such
missiles, pointing with his hand to an 11-inch shell
which was hurtling away after having ricocheted
off the ground; but just at that moment there was
a terrific roar, and he was hidden in the black smoke
from a large shell that had burst just where he stood.
When the smoke had cleared away, he was no longer
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>A message came from the left breastwork to say
that there was hardly a man there, and asking for
at least a few reinforcements, as the Japanese were
beginning to make a move. I sent up Second-Lieutenant
Shakovskoi and twenty men with hand
grenades. At about 12 noon the cannonade was so
terrific that it was impossible to speak in an ordinary
tone of voice, and one had to shout to be heard.
Our lower road was swept by shell, but we had not
many casualties. A new commandant arrived also—Major
Veselevski, a brave and intelligent officer, who
had more than once rendered me good service, and
was always quick at carrying out my instructions.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>It is always good to see an officer calm and collected
in a post of danger—one feels stronger somehow,
both morally and physically. The commandant’s
smiling face and his quiet orders made a forcible
impression on the men. Such a commander always
inspires them with unlimited faith—they look at him
with a kind of superstitious awe, and feel that they
<i>must</i> obey him, even in moments of extreme peril.
I will even assert that, the greater the danger, the
more blindly will the men submit to the will of a commander
who has won their confidence and respect.</p>

<p>A good officer stands for much in battle, just
as a bad one may cause irreparable harm.</p>

<p>Officers should be very carefully selected, and
unreliable ones eliminated by every possible means.
Expert knowledge of military science is not
essential; what really matters is the spirit, the
individuality, of a man; but it is difficult to define
in exact language the characteristics required, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
to recognize them in peace time is yet harder, for
few men display them outwardly. Unfortunately,
a commander does not himself choose his officers,
but has them pitched at his head willy-nilly, and
how, indeed, can one expect to have <i>all</i> officers of
the best type? Still, governors and instructors at
military academies and colleges can be of great
assistance by judicious recommendation.</p>

<p>Honourable pride, nobility of thought, a sense of
the high calling of an officer’s profession—this is what
every military man should have ingrained into his
nature from his youth upward. For this reason
officers must be recruited from families bearing noble
traditions.</p>

<p>Physical strength and health are also important
factors; therefore, officers must be encouraged to
indulge in sport of all kinds, in order to develop
their quickness of movement and strength of limb.</p>

<p>An officer should enjoy a cultured and even
fastidious life, and thus tone down the roughness of
our average army officer. Officers should occupy a
high position in society, but at the same time they
should be trained to endure the hardships of a war
willingly and with equanimity. And to this end
they must always bear in mind that their profession,
even in its smallest details, is one of great national,
and even Imperial, importance.</p>

<p>A really talented officer is priceless, but such a
man is a hundred times more rare than a talented
painter, professor, or other civilian.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The day<a id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> was now far advanced, but the bombardment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>continued without slackening and shells
fell very close to our bomb-proof on the lower road.
All this was the work of the battery at Shui-shih-ying,
which our guns had not yet succeeded in silencing.
Although our bomb-proof was built right up
against the steep cliff, with 8- and 9-inch beams,
the roof was composed only of 8-inch baulks, with
a layer of big stones, cemented with clay, about
an archine thick. Though this was proof against
6-inch shell, as we found when one struck it,
the 11-inch howitzer projectile was quite another
matter.</p>

<p>So we sat in this bomb-proof and quietly talked.
We were surprised at the foolishness of the Japanese—who
were only now beginning to scale 203 Metre
Hill, when they ought to have done so much earlier.
They had been breaking their heads against our strong
central forts, and had lost a whole army in trying
to take them.</p>

<p>What was to prevent them making a landing-in-force
in Pigeon Bay, occupying Lao-tieh Shan,
destroying our fleet from there, and then taking
the New Town, which was very poorly defended
from the Lao-tieh Shan side?</p>

<p>It is absurd to credit them with exceptional knowledge
and skill in military science. Neither do I
acknowledge that they are exceptionally brave, in
which opinion my riflemen agree with me.</p>

<p>The Japanese are very cautious, and they have no
reason to boast of their daring. True, they attack
without flinching; for this there are many reasons:
first of all, their initial success; secondly, the
numerical inferiority of our garrison; and thirdly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the fact that they may be peppered with shrapnel if
they do not advance.</p>

<p>I am absolutely convinced that in a future campaign,
when we have a double line in Manchuria,
when Vladivostok has been strongly fortified, when
we have twice the number of guns, besides Maxims
to every company, we shall utterly defeat them and
drive them off the Continent.</p>

<p>Thus we held forth, sitting in our bomb-proof till
evening. The firing died down, and, following the
example of the men, we were able to bring out our
samovar and have tea.</p>

<p>Our losses on this day, in spite of the heavy gun
fire, were comparatively small. The men had got
to know the place, and had learnt how to avoid
splinters and to find corners immune from fire.</p>

<p>At 8 p.m., as usual, dinner was served with 1 lb.
per head of horse-flesh. The samovars sang, and the
men walked freely up and down the hill, some of
them bathing in the stream at its foot. All then
turned in, except the sentries, who stood with
hand grenades ready and kept a sharp look-out for
the enemy. If a grenade was heard, every one stood
to arms. The men in the trenches were relieved
in turn in small detachments.</p>

<p>The engineers, who were with the reserves that
came up at about 8 p.m. under Acting Ensign Yermolov,
started work by repairing, or I should rather
say by rebuilding, the trenches with their sand-bags,
and in addition began to cut a communication
trench along the rear of the hill. As usual there
was but little of the old trenches left, and it was
fortunate that I had had a considerable number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
bags stored in the regimental depot, ready for such
emergencies.</p>

<p>At 12 midnight I made a tour round the left
breastwork and other fortifications. The former
was completely wrecked, except for its left face,
and the inner ditch was filled with dead bodies.
Providentially everything was quiet, so I gave
orders for them to be carried away. All that
remained of the central battery with its flanking
pieces were piles of rubbish and torn sand-bags.</p>

<p>The right breastwork had not suffered so badly,
and was fully capable of being defended. The
Japanese refrained from attacking it, as the fire from
Akasaka Yama barred the way. One attempt to
attack this part of 203 Metre Hill had cost them
more than a thousand men, and their approaches
were still far from the top.</p>

<p>The left flank of the lower round trench was
quite whole, and the men were perfectly comfortable
there. They had built up a thick, solid wall
between themselves and the ruined portion of the
trench, and had decided to make a small sortie that
night.</p>

<p>On the morning of December 4, owing to the ill-success
of this sortie, there was a good deal of cross
firing and grenade-throwing. The battery near Shui-shih-ying
still gave us considerable trouble, and
three officers and several men were wounded.</p>

<p>At about 8 a.m. heavy rifle firing and a number
of explosions were heard on the left breastwork—an
ominous sign.</p>

<p>I went outside and called up the reserve. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
reported to me that the Japanese were attacking,
and the commander asked for reinforcements, so,
in order to encourage them, I sent up a few
men.</p>

<p>To my surprise I heard shouts from the work
attacked, and saw our men flying down the hill.
They had been driven out and were in full retreat.
With the other officers and the reserve I rushed up to
meet them, hoping to stop the fugitives, but it was
already too late and I was carried off my feet. The
men from the breastwork fled down as far as the
lower slopes of the hill. The reserve, however, stood
fast. I shouted for the commander of the latter,
but he was not to be found, and I had to take his
place.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the reserve consisted of
one of my own companies. We charged up the
hill and drove the Japanese out of the breastwork with
our hand grenades, but those of the enemy inflicted
heavy loss on us. By my orders the breastwork was
then occupied by the reserve.</p>

<p>At this time the commandant was away inspecting
the left flank of the hill, and thus did not see what
was happening. The workmen who were renewing
the central battery between the breastworks assisted
materially in the defeat of the Japanese by attacking
their left flank. I do not know who the officer was
that led them to the attack.</p>

<p>I passed through some bad moments during this
panic, and was thankful that the enemy was not
in force. Afterwards I learnt that the Japanese had
crawled up unnoticed and hurled several grenades
right amongst our men. An officer was killed and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
many men either bayoneted or blown to atoms; the
rest broke and ran.</p>

    <p class="x-small left">p. 268]</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>All my reserves were now used up, so I sent a
request for as many sailors as possible. As a
determined attack now appeared to be imminent, I
went earlier than usual to my observing station.
Rifle firing again broke out in the left breastwork,
a sign that the Japanese were collecting in their
parallels.</p>

<p>The battery at Shui-shih-ying caused us ceaseless
annoyance. In order not to attract its attention,
I gave orders for the dressing station to be removed
to a point near the foot of the hill. I withdrew half
the men from the right breastwork to form a reserve.
But they only sent me ten men, saying that they were
half a company. The men in the left work were
standing firm.</p>

<p>The rifle and grenade duel continued for a very
long time.</p>

<p>Evidently the Japanese had decided not to attack,
being deterred by our hand grenades, and the bombardment
continued without abatement. The 11-inch
“portmanteaus”<a id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> (as the men called the 11-inch shell)
were bursting continually in the right breastwork.
The right flank of the hill was completely wrecked
by them, and the only sign there of what were once
fortifications was the crest-line covered with splinters
and fragments of beams. But, as I have already said,
they did not like attacking this flank, as it was swept
by the flanking fire from the trenches on Akasaka<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Yama of which the Japanese had a great dread
owing to their previous fearful losses.</p>

<p>Many wounded were coming from the left breastwork,
and some, who were not able to walk, were
rolling themselves slowly down. The sight of
these men painfully dragging themselves down the
steep slope always affected me deeply. From time
to time several orderlies had been sent to me
asking for reinforcements and hand grenades.
I could not give them much help, but sent
up five men from the reserve with grenades,
which I hoped would give them some encouragement.</p>

<p>At last, thank God! some sailors arrived, and
with them a number of officers. I at once sent a
detachment into the breastwork under a naval
ensign. They reached it without loss, and climbed
in over the parapet, the entrance having been
destroyed. Suddenly I saw the ensign running out
of the work with about twenty sailors and riflemen in
his train. My heart sank. While I watched them
the ensign lay down, and the sailors, doing the
same, began to fire. As, however, they were in
the very place where the 11-inch shell constantly
fell, I sent the ensign an order to return to the breastwork.
I saw the orderly reach him and give him
my order, but nevertheless they all remained lying
where they were.</p>

<p>My ire rose, and I sent to the ensign to say that
if he remained where he was, I would shoot him like
a dog. In another moment I felt that I had been
too hasty, but the orderly was already gone. About
a quarter of an hour later I received in reply the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
information that a part of the ditch had fallen in
and the parapet had been demolished, making it
impossible to remain there any longer. So I
sent him an apology for my hasty reprimand,
and thanked him for his enterprise and bravery.
A non-commissioned officer, who had come back for
hand grenades, took him this message.</p>

<p>Though many shells fell round the little band of
sailors and the naval ensign, who remained on one
knee with his drawn sword in his hand, no casualties
occurred. Many were wounded, even near the
bomb-proof and on the road, but these men seemed
to bear charmed lives, and all the officers standing
near me marvelled at their extraordinary luck.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there was the scream of an 11-inch
shell. With a deafening roar it burst right over
them, and thick black smoke shut out the awful
picture, while all of us held our breath. The
smoke cleared away, and we saw the sailors still
lying there and the ensign kneeling as before. Once
again we breathed freely. Unfortunately, I forgot
to find out this officer’s name.</p>

<p>The firing began to die down—a sure sign of
impending attack. Our hand grenades burst over the
breastwork in still greater numbers. I sent a party
of sailors towards the work and another into the
central trench to be ready in case of need to charge
with the bayonet from the flank. But no attack
came. The Japanese could not, apparently, bring
themselves to face the shower of grenades.</p>

<p>Evening came on, and we were still awaiting the
attack. Then an alarming incident occurred. A
detachment of our 3rd Company, under Acting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Ensign Moskvin, was stationed in reserve in a gun
emplacement. The men were sitting right at the
bottom of the emplacement, but the Acting Ensign’s
head could be seen over the top. Suddenly
a large shell burst, as it seemed to me, right over
him. When the smoke cleared away, he was
lying motionless on the steps of the emplacement.
He was immediately carried to the road, and
found to be stunned, but apparently unwounded;
how it was that he was not blown to atoms passes
my understanding.</p>

<p>It transpired afterwards that Moskvin had been
injured internally in the chest and head, in consequence
of which he completely lost his hearing and
power of speech, and was paralysed down the right
side. He was a brave lad, and I felt very sorry for him.
About a month afterwards, he regained his speech
and power of movement. Later on he became a
prisoner of war, and eventually died here in Kiev.
I was unable to attend his funeral in person, but my
wife followed his remains to their last resting-place.</p>

<p>The day was now over and there had been no
assault. It was almost incredible. Had I indeed
made a mistake regarding the intentions of the
Japanese?</p>

<p>That evening a great number of units had collected
on 203 Metre Hill, and, in order to prevent overcrowding,
I sent half of them down to the place
where the kitchens were situated.</p>

<p>Any one who carefully reads these lines might very
well ask the question “How is this? Men are constantly
being sent up to the hill, but none seem to
leave it?” But it must be remembered that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
203 Metre Hill cost us 4,000 men.<a id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Units arrived
in good order, but, as soon as heavy losses occurred,
they were usually mixed with later comers.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The senior of those left alive would come to me
and report that such and such a company or detachment
had practically been wiped out, that there
only remained so many men, and could they have a
rest?</p>

<p>I always commended these detachments for their
heroic behaviour, and granted the request provided
there were fresh units on the hill who had had time
to become thoroughly acquainted with its fortifications
and their disposition.</p>

<p>Soon after Moskvin’s unfortunate experience we
became easier in our minds, and collected in the
commandant’s bomb-proof<a id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> to drink tea. The
samovar was singing on the table at which the
commandant and I sat. He gave every one tea in
turn, for we had only two glasses<a id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> left. The naval
men who had just arrived told us of all that had
happened in the centre, where we had brilliantly
beaten back all the Japanese attacks. Every one
was convinced that there would be no more big
assaults of that description, as the enemy had lost
more than 10,000 men.</p>

<p>They told us about Losev, who, on being ordered to
drive the Japanese out of a trench captured by them
under the glacis of Fort Erh-lung, had adopted a
very simple method of carrying out the order.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Accompanied by a few men, he took several grenades
in his arms, climbed straight up on to the glacis and
hurled the grenades into the trench. The Japanese,
thrown into confusion, jumped out of the trench
and retreated, whereupon our men at once reoccupied
it.</p>

<p>Captain Sirotko, commanding our 9th Company,
related all that had happened on Akasaka Yama
during the last few days.</p>

<p>As will be remembered, this important hill was
defended by a trench and a large redoubt on the
summit, called by us Karmenny (the Stone Redoubt).
This redoubt was further strengthened by abattis.
Companies of the 5th and 27th Regiments held
the hill under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Boudiarnski, a strikingly enterprising and daring
officer.</p>

<p>Concurrently with the attacks on 203 Metre Hill
the Japanese assaulted Akasaka Yama, having first
wrecked the trenches in front of the Stone Redoubt
by gun fire.</p>

<p>On November 27, previously sweeping the intended
point of attack with a terrific artillery
fire, they rushed the trenches in front of the Stone
Redoubt, driving out a Scout Detachment and the
4th Company of the 27th Regiment. Lieutenant-Colonel
Boudiarnski took the left half of our 9th
Company out of the trenches which were not being
attacked, and ordered it to go to the support of
its discomfited comrades.</p>

<p>At 7 p.m. this half-company reached the position
indicated, and found a Scout Detachment already
there, on whose left the Japanese were established.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
They immediately occupied this trench to the left
of the Scout Detachment of the 27th Regiment,
driving the Japanese before them, and thus cut
off the retreat of those who were near the Stone
Redoubt and already throwing hand grenades
into it.</p>

<p>The even numbers of the left half-company were
ordered to stand up and fire to the front, while the
odd numbers were to turn about and fire on the
Japanese near the Stone Redoubt. This unexpected
fire from their rear, combined with the rush of our
12th Company and of the 7th Company of the 14th
Regiment from the front out of the Stone Redoubt,
caused a panic among the enemy, who retreated
into the trench occupied by the 9th Company,
where they were bayoneted to a man. The various
units now occupied their former positions and the
men of the left half of our 9th Company returned
to their own trenches.</p>

<p>On November 28, at 1 p.m., the right half of the
9th Company was sent to the Stone Redoubt to the
assistance of the 8th Company of the 27th Regiment,
which was being hard pressed by the Japanese. At
2 p.m. this half-company, under the command of
Sergeant-Major Platonov, reached the 8th Company,
whose commander immediately gave them an order
to extend along the left flank of the Stone Redoubt,
taking cover behind the boulders there. At this
time the Japanese were swarming up 203 Metre Hill,
and had driven back a part of the 4th and 8th Companies
of the 27th Regiment from the col between
203 Metre Hill and Akasaka Yama. The men of
these companies were retiring, but the right half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of the 9th Company opened fire on the attacking
Japanese and compelled them to take shelter in
the trenches. Then, assisted by the retreating
companies, they all rushed in with the bayonet,
drove the enemy out of the trenches they had
occupied, and seized the ones on their left flank.</p>

<p>At 6 p.m. the Japanese again attacked and took the
trenches occupied by the 4th and 5th Companies and
Scout Detachment of the 27th Regiment, together
with the 12th Company of the 5th Regiment. The
companies retreated in disorder, but the left half
of the 9th Company, under Captain Sirotko himself,
was sent up at this moment and reached them
in time. Extending the 4th section, Captain
Sirotko barred the retreat of the fugitives and
turned them back, while the men of the 3rd
section hurled themselves on the captured trenches,
and, swinging round to the left, drove out the
Japanese. Step by step the other companies
then took up their former positions. The men
fought not only with bayonets, but even with naked
fists.</p>

<p>After this decisive repulse of the Japanese the
danger zone was held by the 9th, 10th, and 12th
Companies of the 5th Regiment, who beat off more
than four attacks during the night.</p>

<p>On November 29 the 9th Company was allowed
a well-deserved rest and relegated to the reserve.</p>

<p>On the 30th the Scout Detachment of the 27th
Regiment was driven out of its trenches. The
enemy attacked Akasaka Yama furiously, and as
the commandant was afraid that their local success
against the Scout Detachment might become a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
general one, he sent the 9th Company to occupy
the heights in rear,<a id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> where it stayed until 12
noon. When, however, the 3rd, 10th, and 12th
Companies of the 5th Regiment had successfully
resisted the Japanese attacks, and the assault had
been abandoned, the 9th Company was sent to
strengthen the left flank and to keep touch with
203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>In the evening the left half of this company
received orders to relieve the 3rd Company of the
5th Regiment. About the same time the right half
of the 9th Company, which was holding the lower
line of trenches on the left flank of Akasaka Yama,
repulsed another attack on the col between the
latter and 203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p>On this day three men of the 9th Company, who
had been wounded, returned to their company as
soon as their wounds had been dressed. General
Stessel met them, and rewarded them all with
St. George’s Crosses. Captain Sirotko stated that
these were the only rewards received by the 9th
Company after nine days’ incessant fighting. Many
received rewards afterwards, but it is better to give
them either during the actual fighting—the right of
doing so being given to commanders of companies
beforehand—or directly afterwards. Such immediate
recognition goes far towards raising the spirits
of the various units. General Kondratenko, with
General Stessel’s permission, frequently awarded our
soldiers crosses, and expressed his regret that he
had not more to distribute.</p>

<p>On December 1 the Japanese scaled 203 Metre
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>Hill, and, lying under the steep cliff on the right
flank, began to enfilade the trenches on Akasaka
Yama, but the 9th Company drove them off with
its fire.</p>

<p>To man the trenches near the cliff itself was the
most dangerous duty of all. The enemy constantly
rushed them from their sap-heads, and the men
occupied them very reluctantly. Observation, too,
was extremely difficult, and the place was often left
entirely undefended.</p>

<p>Captain Sirotko drew the commandant’s attention
to this as soon as he learned the state of affairs
from men sent there by him.</p>

<p>On December 2 the 9th Company was ordered to
occupy the practically ruined trenches on the plateau
in front of the Stone Redoubt, a position of the
greatest peril. They were full of bodies, both of
our men and the Japanese, the result of three
attacks made by the 9th and 10th Companies of the
5th Regiment on November 27 and 28.</p>

<p>The Japanese saps were but 20 to 30 paces from
these trenches.</p>

<p>The 9th Company remained in this position until
2 p.m. on December 4.</p>

<p>Throughout this fighting the companies resisted
innumerable attacks with the help of pyroxylin
grenades, which were brought up to the firing line
by men specially detailed for the purpose.</p>

<p>At 2 p.m. on December 4, after nine days’ ceaseless
fighting, the 9th Company was withdrawn, having
lost in killed and wounded 60 per cent. of its strength.
During these nine days the men of the company,
sleepless and worn out, held the trenches under a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
hellish artillery fire, drove the Japanese out of
those they had taken by rifle fire, hand grenades,
and bayonet charges, and beat off every assault
of their persistent enemy, never, even for a moment,
showing the least sign of faltering under this terrible
ordeal.</p>

<p class="noindent">Having finished tea and exhausted our conversation,
we decided to have a rest, but shouting and
firing quickly brought us out of the bomb-proof.
It turned out to be a false alarm. I climbed into
the connecting trench and made sure that all was
right, though the men seemed to be in a restless
condition and were obviously anticipating serious
fighting. I went back to the road and joined a
group of officers there.</p>

<p>We all of us noticed how the Japanese batteries
at Shui-shih-ying were sweeping the whole of our
rear. Just as I was ruminating over this ominous
fact there was a tremendous roar.... I felt a fearful
blow on the left side of my head, and was thrown
into the ditch.</p>

<p>Dazed and all but unconscious, I was unable to
struggle to my feet again. However, I was happy
in the thought that I had not been killed outright.
Some one assisted me to my feet and held me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
up, and I then saw Major Veselovski and several
other officers lying dead near me, the former having
half his head blown away. To my left, most of the
men of the dressing station were lying piled one
on another, and the remainder were already at
work among their fallen comrades. Lieutenant
Rofalovski, a very brave fellow, who had formerly
been my orderly officer, suddenly appeared on the
scene and helped to carry me below. I thought
that I could walk, but was hardly in a fit state to
judge.</p>

<p>So I was carried down to the lower dressing station,
feeling a stream of warm blood trickling down my
neck, and on arrival there my head was bandaged.
Of what happened after that, I have not much
recollection, but I remember people talking from
time to time as I lay in a semi-conscious condition.
Finally I lost all consciousness, until I heard some
one say: “That is Colonel Tretyakov.” I then
opened my eyes, and at the same moment felt a
sharp, stabbing pain on the left side of my face and
head. I was being carried along on a stretcher. Some
one was riding behind me, and the sound of hoofs
on the hard road beat painfully into my head. “Who
is riding?” I asked. They told me I heard my
own chargers, which were always kept under shelter
near the kitchens when I was on the hill. By the
time we reached the town, consciousness had completely
returned, but the pain in my head and neck
increased, and one of my eyes throbbed badly. I
thought that it must have been put out, and
touched it with my hand, but it seemed to be
all right. I could not see with it, because my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
head and that side of my face were covered with
bandages.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards, my stretcher was put
down, and a doctor bent over me. “How do you
feel?” he asked. “My head is very painful.” The
doctor examined me and said that I was going on
well. Feeling somewhat encouraged by this, I sat
up on the stretcher, but my head ached terribly
and I felt dizzy. I heard some one say in a
whisper: “Well, there’s no hope; the brain is
severely lacerated.”</p>

<p>I involuntarily felt my head, but it seemed to me
to be all right. Then it dawned upon me that they
were referring to the unfortunate commandant,
Veselovski. Soon afterwards, I was taken to the
Red Cross Hospital and comfortably installed
there.</p>

<p>On examination the surgeons found a number of
small splinters in my head and neck, as well as a
very large one in my eye, which they removed
at once. There was one big splinter in my neck,
which had lodged near the spinal column and prevented
me from turning my head. I could even
feel it with my hand. Then they applied the
X-rays and extracted it, but a bit of splintered
bone was left, which I can feel even now.</p>

<p>For three days I lay racked with pain, but after
that the pain grew less and I began to take an
interest in what was going on around me.</p>

<p>But I am going on too fast.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Saifoolin took my place on
the hill, but he was wounded in the same arm,
and almost in the same part, in which, during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the battle of Nan Shan, he had been wounded
before.</p>

<p>On the evening of December 6 I heard a rumour
that 203 Metre Hill had been captured, and on the
7th my adjutant arrived and confirmed this disastrous
intelligence.</p>

<p>On the fall of 203 Metre Hill we abandoned Akasaka
Yama, as well as Division and False Hills. Division
Hill was an irreparable loss to us, as it was not only
capable of being defended step by step, but, moreover,
it protected Ta-an-tzu Shan Fort. Without
doubt, the defenders could have held out for some
time longer. Colonel Irman himself tried to recapture
it, but was unable to collect sufficient men
for the purpose. I also heard that the following
men remained in the commandant’s bomb-proof:
Lossev, a telephonist, Second-Lieutenant Goudkov,
the wounded commander of our 6th Company, and
part of our 1st Scout Detachment, who refused to
leave the hill and remained at their post in the
right breastwork.</p>

<p>With these men in the work it might have been
possible to drive out the Japanese once again, but
apparently General Kondratenko considered it inexpedient
to continue holding the hill at a possible
cost of 500 men per day, and this, perhaps, was a
sufficient reason for evacuating it. Colonel Irman
had to send several men to the breastwork with
direct orders to the 1st Scout Detachment to
leave the hill, before they would forsake their post.</p>

<p>The following is the account of the final struggle
for 203 Metre Hill as I heard it from Captain
Sirotko.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>About 1 p.m. on December 5 the 9th Company<a id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
was moved from the staff headquarters to 203
Metre Hill. Thirty-six men of the Medical Corps
had just been added to it, so that it now consisted
of one company officer, two acting ensigns, and
102 rank and file. General Kondratenko in person
gave the company an order to reach the hill as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>Under a heavy rifle fire, which caused several
casualties, the company reached the foot of 203 Metre
Hill about 2 p.m. Just as it reached the hill,
the Japanese captured the whole of the crest-line
and began sweeping the road in rear with rifle fire
and throwing down stones and hand grenades. Our
6th Company, posted on the reverse slopes, suffered
heavily from these missiles.</p>

<p>The trench above the road was full of riflemen of
various companies and units, but they could not be
induced to leave their cover.</p>

<p>Therefore, Lieutenant-Colonel Saifoolin ordered the
9th Company to advance across the open to the left
of the trench. Under a hail of bullets, stones, and
grenades, the company charged up with the bayonet
and drove the enemy out of the ruined trench on
the crest-line. Then the remainder of the men,
encouraged by their comrades’ success, made a rush
for the summit.</p>

<p>The company, with Captain Sirotko, Acting Ensigns
Lesenkov and Grouzdev, and the squad and section
commanders at its head, then rushed out of the
position it had just taken, and charged over the crest,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>supported on its right flank by the 6th Company
under Captain Sazonov and Second-Lieutenant
Goudkov. They were, however, met by such a
storm of bullets, shrapnel, and grenades, that in a
few moments they lost half their men, Second-Lieutenant
Goudkov being very severely wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Sirotko was badly wounded in the head
and arm, and, losing consciousness, fell backwards
down the hill. When he came to himself, all the
men had again retreated into the trench, which
was wreathed in flames on its left flank where the
telephone bomb-proof stood. All the officers were
now <i>hors de combat</i>, except on the right flank, where
Lieutenant-Colonel Pokrovski, who had replaced
Lieutenant-Colonel Saifoolin, badly wounded while
commandant of the hill, was still unhurt. Two more
attacks—one led by Lieutenant-Colonel Pokrovski,
the other by Colonel Irman—were equally unsuccessful,
and cost us dear. Nevertheless, our men
still clung to the rear slopes of the hill.</p>

<p>About midnight, when Captain Sirotko had been
attended to and had somewhat recovered, General
Kondratenko, who was at the staff headquarters,
sent him four midshipmen and an acting ensign of
the 27th Regiment, under whom another attack on
the Japanese above might be made. By this time,
however, the enemy had succeeded in dragging some
machine guns to the top of the hill, which was now
strongly held. Realizing this, and that enormous
losses would be incurred in any further attacks,
Colonel Irman decided to evacuate the hill, and gave
the order for a general retreat.</p>

<p>It is a pity that we did not adopt the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
tactics, of overwhelming the enemy with gun fire
and then seizing the hill without loss.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>During this fighting the 9th Company lost all its
officers, and 60 per cent. of its men were killed or
wounded. From September 6 to December 22 this
company lost 253 men killed and wounded, <i>i.e.</i>
60 per cent. in excess of its actual war strength of
155 men. It had performed the following duties:
covering the retreat from Namako Yama; three
bayonet attacks on the enemy occupying the trenches
on the left flank of Akasaka Yama—all of them
successful; the repulse of numerous attacks on the
left flank of Akasaka Yama; and the three last
gallant, though unsuccessful, attempts to recapture
203 Metre Hill.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The Red Cross Hospital was abundantly supplied
with everything necessary for such an institution in
a besieged fortress.</p>

<p>Thanks to the number of nurses, and their tender
care of the wounded, the hospital was more or less
like one’s own home, and the patients felt themselves
very comfortable there after life in the trenches.</p>

<p>In the evening numbers of officers came in from
the fighting lines to have their wounds dressed, and
they had much interesting news to tell us. The
stories I heard from them, and from those who were
lying there wounded, were so interesting and so
detailed, that if it had been possible to write them
down, I could have compiled a full and instructive
account of the whole siege. But, as it was, I was
too weak to attempt the task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>What depressed me and every one else was the
thought that we were being beaten without being
able to defend ourselves.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the enormous superiority
of the enemy in guns, and the scurvy that was
raging in the fortress, one could almost with certainty
fix the period within which the final stand
must be made. In my own mind I allowed about
two months. News from the Manchurian Army
was far from reassuring, and gave us no hope of
relief.</p>

<p>For three days after the fall of 203 Metre Hill the
Japanese bombarded our ships. The naval men
who came in said that the fleet was now doomed.
It would soon be at the bottom of the sea, and
without it the squadron coming from home would
be useless in view of the enemy’s strength.</p>

<p>I cannot understand how any of us could have
buoyed ourselves up with the hope that our Far
Eastern Fleet was a match for the Japanese.</p>

<p>Was it, indeed, impossible to have foreseen that
they would sooner or later protect their own
interests? Had we realized the situation and
sent three or four more battleships<a id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> to the Far
East, there would have been no war and above all
no triumph for the Japanese.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>To our own mistakes, to our own blindness, and
not to the enemy’s valour, I attribute our <i>débâcle</i>.
When we have made good our shortcomings, victory
will be ours. Of this I am assured, for I know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the characteristics of the Japanese, I know their
army, and I know their men.</p>

<p>I did not notice any despondency among our
officers, but good ones were becoming scarce.</p>

<p>An officer from Fort Chi-kuan told us that the
Japanese had for some time been masters of the
ditch, but, fearing to attack us, remained on that
side of the parapet.</p>

<p>Our men were rolling 10-lb. naval mines into the
ditch, and I can imagine the effect of the explosion
of these implements of destruction. The Japanese
tried to drive us out of the caponier of this fort by
burning in it material soaked in arsenic. Our men
were stifled by the fumes, and the sentries in the
casemates had to be relieved every few minutes.
Fort Erh-lung was in a similar plight.</p>

<p>On the evening of December 16 a report reached
us that General Kondratenko had been killed. I
refused to believe it, but a few minutes afterwards
some wounded eye-witnesses were carried in—a
young artillery officer, and an ensign of a Reserve
Engineer Company, named Schmidt—who verified
the rumour.</p>

<p>It seems that about 8 p.m. on the 15th, General
Kondratenko went to Fort Chi-kuan, nearly all the
senior officers of that section of the defence being
already there, amongst others Lieutenant-Colonel
Rashevski, Major Zedginidzi, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Naoomenko. They had been summoned to
discuss the question of further defensive measures
at that point, as the defenders were in desperate
straits from the poisonous gases they encountered
during mining operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The casemate where the conference took place
having been struck more than once by 11-inch
shells, the ruined part had been shut off by a stout
partition made of baulks, and a hole, made by a
shell, in the vaulted roof had been filled up with
loose stones, resting on a pile of mortar and heavy
fragments of beams, with which the interior of
the casemate was strewn. This I had myself
noticed during occasional visits to this ill-omened
fort.</p>

<p>General Kondratenko sat at the table with his
back to the partition, while other officers were
seated on forms. The rest were standing near the
entrance to the casemate. Suddenly there was a
terrific explosion, and the latter, who were the only
ones that escaped alive, were blown through the
entrance, while the whole of the interior fell in.
When they recovered their senses, soldiers were
already in the casemate removing the dead. With
the General perished the flower of the officers of
that section.<a id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The death of General Kondratenko made a
lasting impression on the garrison; every one lost
heart, since we knew there was none to take his
place.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, our fleet ceased to exist,
and although the ships’ companies went to swell
the numbers of our reserves, from that moment
misfortune dogged us.</p>

<p>On December 18 the Japanese exploded a mine
under the parapet of Fort Chi-kuan. It did not
make a very large breach, and the garrison retreated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>from the parapet to the retrenchment behind, and
thus prevented the enemy from seizing the former;
but in spite of this, at 11 p.m. we evacuated the
fort. Captain Kvatz, the commandant, told me
when he came into hospital that he had withdrawn
his men in pursuance of General Fock’s orders, and
that he himself considered that further resistance
was not justified. Although, according to him, 100
lives were sacrificed daily in the effort to hold this
position, nevertheless I could not accept his conclusion,
since there was still one casemate in the
fort which was absolutely untouched. However, the
loss of this fort was not so very serious, because
it was on a very low site, and behind and above it
was the Chinese Wall, which had already rendered
us great service during innumerable attacks.</p>

<p>By December 24 I had quite recovered, and my
eye no longer pained me. Dr. Mirotvoretz had
operated successfully, and removed a splinter from
my neck.</p>

<p>Everything had been quiet in my section during
my illness, as the Japanese were concentrating
against the eastern front and taking no further
action against us.</p>

<p>I was discharged from hospital on December 25.
On reaching my section, I found that the staff headquarters
had been moved, and was now placed
behind the crest of a hill, near Battery No. 4, where
it was completely protected. With Colonel Irman’s
staff I found many of the town officials, among them
Colonel Vershinin, the head of the Kuan-tung
Peninsula district. Messing arrangements had been
made, and there was plenty of everything, but as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
charges were exceedingly high, our officers preferred to
dine separately. I felt very well during the evening,
but the wound in my neck became so painful that
night, that in the morning I had fever, and had to
return to hospital for three days.</p>

<p>Having had my wound disinfected, I again rejoined
my regiment.</p>

<p>During this time the Japanese had attacked Interval
Hill, where our 2nd and 3rd Companies,
under Lieutenant Ivanov, were posted. The attacks
began at 2 a.m. on December 25, but they were all
repulsed by our fire from the trenches and from a
lunette occupied by the 7th Company. About ten of
the enemy, however, succeeded in climbing up a hill
somewhere in rear, where they dug themselves in.
Lieutenant Ivanov reported this to Colonel Irman,
and said that he would turn them out. This was
quite unnecessary, as they would probably have
retreated later of their own accord; nevertheless,
Colonel Irman ordered the companies to leave Interval
Hill and take up a position behind our line,
in touch with our 11th Company.</p>

<p>On December 26 we evacuated Solovev Hill, near
Pigeon Bay.</p>

<p>The 5th Regiment was now concentrated on
our main inner position and occupied the space
between two permanent forts, presenting a considerably
stronger front than before; it had also been
brought up, for the third time, to its full complement.
The Japanese were now faced with a problem
similar to that previously presented by 174 Metre
Hill, but rendered additionally difficult by the existence
of permanent fortifications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>They wisely decided not to repeat their rash
attacks of the past, and contented themselves with
remaining in the positions they had occupied. Thus
everything was fairly peaceful, and I availed myself
fully of this interval of quiet, feeling that it was
safe to leave the staff headquarters occasionally.</p>

<p>First of all, I went to see Colonel Grigorenko, but,
being unable to find his house, I went on to the
commandant’s. There I met Colonel Khvostov, who
had just arrived with a report. We had a long
talk about the situation, and I carried away with me
the impression that no disaster was threatening us
for some time to come.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>It seemed that, in the event of the capture of Fort
Erh-lung, the commandant had a second line of
defence, which we could hope to hold against the
enemy for a considerable time.</p>

<p>One would have thought that the rocky ground
would have prevented the enemy from mining
beneath Forts Erh-lung and Sung-shu, but nevertheless
by now they were making rapid progress there.
We could not make a very stubborn resistance at
these points because we had no miners, and, consequently,
no system of counter-mining. The counterscarp
galleries were merely blocked with stones and
cement, which became so solid that it would have
taken about three days to destroy, as proved to be
the case at Fort Chi-kuan.</p>

<p>Some time before this, General Kondratenko had
asked me to come and make an investigation. One
night (I do not remember the date) I went with
Colonel Grigorenko to Fort Erh-lung, where I found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
General Kondratenko in the counterscarp gallery.
After listening attentively to the Japanese working
on the other side, we came to the conclusion that
they were tunnelling in three separate parts of
the outside wall of the gallery. They evidently
wished to make breaches in this wall by exploding
several small charges, and thus get through into
the gallery. As we could only offer a passive
resistance, we determined to block the gallery
with a large boulder and cement it hard against
those portions of the wall where the Japanese was
working. This plan was carried into effect at
once.</p>

<p>All this took place some time before, and the
enemy were now right under the breastwork of the
fort and ready to explode several charges. In
anticipation of this the fort was evacuated except
for sentries on the parapets. Imagine the frame
of mind of a sentry who knows that at any moment
he may be blown to atoms! The commandant,
having made arrangements for further resistance
in case of the destruction of the fort and subsequent
Japanese attack, was quietly awaiting events.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Having breakfasted with the commandant, and
heard a full account of the state of our defences,
I returned to the headquarters of the regiment.
The Japanese were directing a somewhat heavy
fire towards the road along the shore, but the
shells mostly fell into the water beyond.</p>

    <p class="x-small left">p. 292]</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On December 28 I again rode into the town.
While crossing the bridge over the Lun-ho, I felt
the earth tremble slightly and then heard a loud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
rumble in the distance. Looking up, I saw a
huge column of black smoke hanging over Fort
Erh-lung. “Well,” I thought to myself, “the
fort is blown up, and possibly taken, but there
is not much harm done, as the Chinese Wall is
behind it.”</p>

<p>When I reached the staff, all the details were
known. It turned out that the explosion had not
been entirely successful, as we were still masters of
the retrenchment, but we had lost heavily owing to
the rain of shells into the fort. Rumour said that
the Japanese themselves had suffered heavy losses
from the explosion, that the whole of the trench
nearest the fort had been wrecked, and that the
men of the attacking party, who were waiting in
it, had perished in the ruins.<a id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>In my section everything was quiet, and we spent
the evening quite happily, congratulating ourselves
that the Japanese had not broken down the defence
of the fort, which they could have done if they had
exploded their 150-lb. pyroxylin charges under the
parapets.</p>

<p>But our joy was premature. The following day
we learnt that Fort Ehr-lung had been evacuated in
the night; all <i>matériel</i>, cartridges, and shells had
been removed beforehand. Besides the fort, we had
also abandoned that part of the Chinese Wall which
ran straight to the rear from both flanks, and had
occupied a position on a rocky crest-line behind, and
on a height to the left of it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>
<p>Our perilous situation in the centre of the line,
the deadly artillery fire, the constantly repeated
attacks, and the endless vigil wore out our men,
and their spirits began to flag in a marked degree.</p>

<p>In a great battle, soldiers may make a stubborn
fight, especially if victory may yet be snatched or
some great prize won for the Fatherland. But if
after constant fighting there is no apparent gain; if
they are, each moment, exposed to deadly peril;
if from each individual heroic effort is demanded,
not for one soul-stirring moment alone, but ceaselessly,
with certain death the only reward,—it is
pardonable if hearts grow faint, if men are at times
found wanting in energy and slow to carry out orders.</p>

<p>Then is the time for reliefs; but for us there were
none available.</p>

<p>Scurvy, moreover, claimed its victims, bringing in
its train suffering and weakness. Nourishing diet
was necessary, and I do not know why we spared
the artillery horses. Long ago we had lost all hope
of any offensive action, so ere this the gun horses
might well have furnished the men with meat once
a day. They may perhaps have been utilized in
other ways, though the fact remains that by this
means we might have kept, fit and well in the
trenches, more than another thousand men!</p>

<p>On December 30 we were dining peacefully, when
suddenly tremendous firing burst forth from all
our batteries, and the rattle of musketry along the
front told us that the Japanese were making a
determined attack.</p>

<p>We all rushed up on to the hill, but nothing was
visible save the smoke from our own batteries and from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
bursting shrapnel. All our forts were smothered with
shell, though we could not see the enemy’s infantry.
I tried to get some news through the telephone, but
it was already overtaxed and continuously in use.</p>

<p>Only in the evening did we learn that the Japanese
had made a fierce attack on the Chinese Wall and
Naval Ridge beyond. This attack had been repulsed
with enormous loss to the enemy, who had,
however, succeeded in fortifying themselves at the
foot of Naval Ridge, and thus enfiladed the Chinese
Wall. Still, even that was not of supreme importance,
since the Chinese Wall had a number of
traverses and splinter-proofs along it.</p>

<p>In my section all was quiet. We had not a single
man in reserve, but even so we believed we could
beat back every attack. This was not the case,
however, on Lao-tieh Shan, where Major Romanovski
had practically only our mounted Scout Detachments.
The enemy constantly attacked them, and captured
another hill near Pigeon Bay. This was decidedly
serious, as now the Japanese had nothing but these
scouts between them and the other half of the
western front, where there was but a remnant of the
27th Regiment, the main portion of it being required
on the front attacked, which was held by only a
few men.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Japanese seemed content with
the success already gained, and settled down for their
usual long rest, or, possibly, their men were also
required on the front of attack.</p>

<p>On December 31, after tea, we received news of a
further disaster. Yet once again in this disastrous
war had fortune favoured the Japanese. Fort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Sung-shu had been blown up, and, what was worse,
in one stroke the whole garrison had been annihilated.
This is what had happened: About a thousand
hand grenades had been stored in an excavation
which the garrison also used as a shelter. A
Japanese shell burst, detonating these grenades, and
the whole place collapsed on the garrison. This
was a fearful blow to us, and we deeply lamented
the death of our gallant comrades and their commandant.<a id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Fate had indeed played us a sorry trick!</p>

<p>We were all dispirited, and few cared to partake of
dinner that night.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 31st we evacuated the
Chinese Wall<a id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and took up positions at Wang-tai
and on the Mitrofanievski, Vladimirski, and Laperovski
Hills.<a id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> It now became very difficult for us to
hold out on the front exposed to attack. We ought
to have begun fortifying the New Town on the side
facing the Old Town, but no orders were received
to that effect. What were our commanders doing?</p>

    <p class="x-small left">p. 296]</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>That night we were all very depressed. Every
one discussed plans for continuing the defence, if
only till the new year.<a id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> This was the universal wish,
and could certainly have been realized. We dispersed
at a late hour, to be aroused in the morning
by heavy firing. On climbing the hill, we saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Wang-tai literally swept with shell, and so covered
with smoke that it was impossible to see its summit.
The bombardment continued for a long time. We
could not follow exactly what was taking place, but
learnt in the evening that the Japanese had captured
it. Our reserves had at first quickly driven
back the enemy, afterwards repulsing five further
attacks, but towards evening, when there were only
three or four of the defenders left, the sixth assault
was successful.</p>

<p>That evening, by General Fock’s order, the whole
of our front from Wang-tai to Chi-kuan Battery was
evacuated.</p>

<p>The same night the Japanese attacked Signal
Hill, near Takhe Bay, but were repulsed.</p>

<p>On January 2, 1905, the majority of the officers
were collected at the staff headquarters to hear the
latest reports. Suddenly an officer came galloping
out of the town and informed us that he had
himself seen two officers riding out beyond our
lines with a white flag.</p>

<p>My heart froze at this news. We all remained
silent for some time, seeking to hide our discomfiture.</p>

<p>“Can that mean surrender?” said some one at
last.</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” answered another.</p>

<p>After a full minute’s silence conversation broke
out noisily on all sides. Every one asked what was
to be done under the circumstances, and as they were
all talking at once, it was impossible to understand
anything. But general indignation against General
Fock was apparent, and every kind of accusation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
was heaped upon his head. I do not remember how
long this continued, but I know that we had not yet
sat down to dinner, when we received the fateful news
by telephone: “Arthur surrendered. The officers are
allowed to keep their swords and return to Russia
after giving their parole not to take any further part
in the present war.”</p>

<p>There was a tremendous commotion at the receipt
of this news. The majority had no wish to surrender,
and vehemently attacked our seniors for surrendering
the fortress without the consent of all the
officers. Some of them wanted to set out immediately
for Lao-tieh Shan and continue the defence
there; others proposed to hire Chinese junks and
leave the fortress, so as not to become prisoners
of war; only a few decided to bow to the will of
their commanders. As each one insisted on his
opinion being accepted, the discussion soon became
very heated, and there was a danger of untoward
results.</p>

<p>Eventually those who wished to defend themselves
on Lao-tieh Shan gave up the idea, as owing
to the lack of water and fortifications of any kind
it would be impossible to hold that position. Those
who had thought of escaping in junks could not do
so, owing to contrary winds.</p>

<p>How long this stormy scene lasted I do not
remember, but at its very height some one rode
up and told us that the senior officers had sent a
telegram to the Tsar asking whether the exemptions
obtained by the authorities for the officers were to
be accepted or not. This news seemed to have a
quieting effect, but with one accord every one determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
to express his disapproval of the action of
the authorities by an absolute refusal of all exemptions
that had been granted as the price of the
capitulation of the fortress. All were resolved to
share the fate of the men and endure with them the
humiliation of becoming prisoners of war. It was
a praiseworthy decision, and I expressed my approval,
but at the same time several arguments against it
presented themselves. Many of these were unheard,
as there was much loud discussion. The two chief
points advanced were:</p>

<p>(1) As prisoners of war, the rank and file would
be separated from their officers and distributed in
various places throughout Japan, hence the presence
of the latter would be of no help to them, nor would
it lessen their hardships.</p>

<p>(2) As an enormous number of officers had been
withdrawn from Russia in order to make good the
losses sustained in Manchuria, the need of them at
home was a very urgent one, and in the event of
war in Turkestan, which was more than probable, we
should find ourselves in a most critical position.
Even without war the want of officers would
jeopardize the efficiency of those regiments and reserve
battalions that were left. Some 500 officers
were in question, and these in Japanese prisons
could render no service to their country in her hour
of need.</p>

<p>Besides all this I added: “Gentlemen, people in
Russia might think that we officers became prisoners
of war in order to spend a pleasant time in beautiful
Japan, free from all duty and hardship, at a time
when disturbances are taking place in the centre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of our own country, and she has great need of all
those who are anxious for her welfare.”</p>

<p>The officers of my regiment agreed with me and
decided to return to Russia, and I can add now that
they were far from being of no use here at home, as
the regiments in the south were almost without officers,
a deficiency which led, as is well known, to serious
disorders in the reserve battalions; so that their
arrival was most timely.</p>

<p>When the surrender of Port Arthur became an
acknowledged fact, we had great difficulty in preserving
order in the fortress.</p>

<p>The soldiers felt that something beyond belief had
happened, something savouring of disgrace to the
brave Russian Army and the Russian Empire as
a whole.</p>

<p>“Have we got to surrender, sir?” cried my men
when I inspected the companies for the last time.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lads,” I answered. “We have been
ordered to surrender; but no blame attaches to the
5th Regiment, and you can with a clear conscience
tell each and every one that the 5th Regiment has
always looked death bravely in the face and has been
ready to die without question for its Tsar and its
Country. Every one knows this, and no one will
dare to cast a word of reproach at you. As you
have always been, so you remain, true heroes, known
to the Japanese, to our great and dear Fatherland,
and to the whole world. Your conscience is as clear
as the sky above you.”</p>

<p>Many of them burst into tears, and I could hardly
speak for the sobs that choked me.</p>

<p>A wrinkled old man who was standing near me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and was the sole witness of our emotion, snatched his
cap off his head, and, waving it triumphantly in the
air, shouted: “To the honour of the 5th Regiment,
hurrah!” But there was no one to follow his
lead.</p>

<p>Even now I feel overcome as I recall these sorrowful
moments, and I can dwell no longer on a scene
so heartbreaking.</p>

<p>According to our Official History none of the Japanese divisions
landed near Terminal Point itself, but in the first place made
use of Pi-tzu-wo and Hou-ta-shih, and afterwards Dalny. There
are two Ta-scha rivers, 15 miles apart, the most northerly one
being that indicated in the text.</p>

<p>The Japanese went down into the water on the right flank as
the tide receded, and sat or lay there until ready for their final
attack. Their opponents apparently thought them dead, and
later were surprised by an attack from that quarter.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The term “scout detachment” is used in all official accounts,
and will be used throughout this work, to denote a detachment, either
mounted or on foot, composed of volunteers (“okhotnik”) and
attached to various regiments. All Russian volunteers were thus
organized.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Accounts received on the Nan Shan position were probably
greatly exaggerated, as something of the nature of a panic ensued
upon the first Japanese torpedo attack (see Official History, Part III.,
pp. 10 <i>et seq.</i>). Two battleships and one cruiser were injured in this
attack.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> An “Acting Ensign” is a senior non-commissioned officer who
has done his service with the colours, and ranks next to an Ensign in
the Reserve, and, like him, wears officer’s uniform.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Though the rank of Major does not exist in the Russian Army, it is
used in this translation to denote the Captain Commanding a Battery,
Company, or Squadron, in contradistinction to Captain, which term
must be understood as applying to a Russian Staff Captain, a rank
corresponding to the rank of Second-Captain formerly existing in the
British Royal Artillery.</p></div>

p. 16).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> This seems to be underestimated, as the Official History gives
4,400 yards as the breadth of the position. The author evidently
means that at low water the <i>whole</i> breadth of the peninsula was
8 versts, which agrees with other accounts.</p></div>

as good as any of its date, all of it being hardened in accordance with
modern processes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> General Tretyakov was evidently still under the impression that
three Russian battleships had been <i>blown up</i>. The Russians had in
reality four first-class battleships still unharmed—<i>Petropavlovsk</i>,
<i>Pobieda</i>, <i>Poltava</i>, and <i>Peresviet</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The 13th, 14th, and 15th Regiments were actually posted in

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> See Official History, Part II., p. 11. This news must have come
from some of Colonel Rantsov’s cossacks.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> It seems unlikely that any of these marauding bands were assisting
the Japanese. It must be remembered that the Russians had no
good word for the Japanese at this time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The Russian soldiers invariably sing on the march, when the

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> In our Official History (Part II.) this action is briefly described
as an engagement with General Nadyein’s rearguard, but it is evident
that two separate reconnaissances were made on May 8 and 16 respectively,
and that no rearguard was left as indicated in that report.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> In Part II. of the Official History (p. 43, par. 2) the estimated
losses were 150 officers and men killed and wounded. For the Russian
estimate, see following page.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> The Official History gives General Nadyein as the commander
during the battle, but General Fock himself conducted the action,
General Nadyein being in command of the left flank.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The attack on Chin-chou here mentioned as taking place on
May 22 is not given in any of the official accounts, the first mentioned
being that of May 25, which is <i>also</i> described here. These two may,
however, be one and the same, owing to confusion of dates.</p></div>

or, more correctly speaking, “parapets” had to be built up, 5 feet
high and 4 feet thick, with sand-bags, as ordinary digging was impossible
in the rocky formation of 203 Metre Hill. This accounts
for the slow rate of progress. Though it is not clear from the narrative,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
